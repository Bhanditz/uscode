-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and unless the head
    of the department or independent establishment concerned shall
    determine it to be inconsistent with the public interest, or the
    cost to be unreasonable, only such unmanufactured articles,
    materials, and supplies as have been mined or produced in the
    United States, and only such manufactured articles, materials, and
    supplies as have been manufactured in the United States
    substantially all from articles, materials, or supplies mined,
    produced, or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United
    States, shall be acquired for public use. This section shall not
    apply with respect to articles, materials, or supplies for use
    outside the United States, or if articles, materials, or supplies
    of the class or kind to be used or the articles, materials, or
    supplies from which they are manufactured are not mined, produced,
    or manufactured, as the case may be, in the United States in
    sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a
    satisfactory quality. This section shall not apply to manufactured
    articles, materials, or supplies procured under any contract the
    award value of which is less than or equal to the micro-purchase
    threshold under section 428 of this title.
    (b) Reports
      (1) In general
        Not later than 180 days after the end of each of fiscal years

      to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of
      the Senate and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform
      of the House of Representatives a report on the amount of the
      acquisitions made by the agency in that fiscal year of articles,
      materials, or supplies purchased from entities that manufacture
      the articles, materials, or supplies outside of the United
      States.
      (2) Contents of report
        The report required by paragraph (1) shall separately include,
      for the fiscal year covered by such report - 
          (A) the dollar value of any articles, materials, or supplies
        that were manufactured outside the United States;

        such articles, materials, or supplies under this Act, and a
        citation to the treaty, international agreement, or other law
        under which each waiver was granted;
          (C) if any articles, materials, or supplies were acquired
        from entities that manufacture articles, materials, or supplies
        outside the United States, the specific exception under this
        section that was used to purchase such articles, materials, or
        supplies; and
          (D) a summary of - 
            (i) the total procurement funds expended on articles,
          materials, and supplies manufactured inside the United
          States; and
            (ii) the total procurement funds expended on articles,
          materials, and supplies manufactured outside the United
          States.
      (3) Public availability
        The head of each Federal agency submitting a report under
      paragraph (1) shall make the report publicly available to the
      maximum extent practicable.
      (4) Exception for intelligence community
        This subsection shall not apply to acquisitions made by an
      agency, or component thereof, that is an element of the
      intelligence community as specified in, or designated under,
      section 401a(4) of title 50.

-STATUTE-
      (a) Every contract for the construction, alteration, or repair of
    any public building or public work in the United States growing out
    of an appropriation heretofore made or hereafter to be made shall
    contain a provision that in the performance of the work the
    contractor, subcontractors, material men, or suppliers, shall use
    only such unmanufactured articles, materials, and supplies as have
    been mined or produced in the United States, and only such
    manufactured articles, materials, and supplies as have been
    manufactured in the United States substantially all from articles,
    materials, or supplies mined, produced, or manufactured, as the
    case may be, in the United States except as provided in section 10a
    of this title: Provided, however, That if the head of the
    department or independent establishment making the contract shall
    find that in respect to some particular articles, materials, or
    supplies it is impracticable to make such requirement or that it
    would unreasonably increase the cost, an exception shall be noted
    in the specifications as to that particular article, material, or
    supply, and a public record made of the findings which justified
    the exception.
      (b) If the head of a department, bureau, agency, or independent
    establishment which has made any contract containing the provision

      Ex. Ord. No. 10582, Dec. 17, 1954, 19 F.R. 8723, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 11051, Sept. 27, 1962, 27 F.R. 9683; Ex. Ord. No.
    12148, July 20, 1979, 44 F.R. 43239; Ex. Ord. No. 12608, Sept. 9,
    1987, 52 F.R. 34617, provided:
      Section 1. As used in this order, (a) the term "materials"
    includes articles and supplies, (b) the term "executive agency"
    includes executive department, independent establishment, and other
    instrumentality of the executive branch of the Government, and (c)
    the term "bid or offered price of materials of foreign origin"
    means the bid or offered price of such materials delivered at the
    place specified in the invitation to bid including applicable duty
    and all costs incurred after arrival in the United States.
      Sec. 2. (a) For the purposes of this order materials shall be
    considered to be of foreign origin if the cost of the foreign
    products used in such materials constitutes fifty per centum or
    more of the cost of all the products used in such materials.
      (b) For the purposes of the said act of March 3, 1933 [see Tables
    for classification], and the other laws referred to in the first
    paragraph of the preamble of this order, the bid or offered price
    of materials of domestic origin shall be deemed to be unreasonable,
    or the purchase of such materials shall be deemed to be
    inconsistent with the public interest, if the bid or offered price
    thereof exceeds the sum of the bid or offered price of like
    materials of foreign origin and a differential computed as provided
    in subsection (c) of this section.
      (c) The executive agency concerned shall in each instance
    determine the amount of the differential referred to in subsection
    (b) of this section on the basis of one of the following-described
    formulas, subject to the terms thereof:
      (1) The sum determined by computing six per centum of the bid or
    offered price of materials of foreign origin.
      (2) The sum determined by computing ten per centum of the bid or
    offered price of materials of foreign origin exclusive of
    applicable duty and all costs incurred after arrival in the United
    States: provided that when the bid or offered price of materials of
    foreign origin amounts to less than $25,000, the sum shall be
    determined by computing ten per centum of such price exclusive only
    of applicable duty.
      Sec. 3. Nothing in this order shall affect the authority or
    responsibility of an executive agency:
      (a) To reject any bid or offer for reasons of the national
    interest not described or referred to in this order; or
      (b) To place a fair proportion of the total purchases with small
    business concerns in accordance with section 302(b) of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [41
    U.S.C. 252(b)], section 2(b) of the Armed Services Procurement Act
    of 1947, as amended [41 U.S.C. 151(b)], and section 202 of the
    Small Business Act of 1953 [15 U.S.C. 631]; or
      (c) To reject a bid or offer to furnish material of foreign
    origin in any situation in which the domestic supplier offering the
    lowest price for furnishing the desired materials undertakes to
    produce substantially all of such materials in areas of substantial
    unemployment, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance
    with such appropriate regulations as he may establish and during
    such period as the President may determine that it is in the
    national interest to provide to such areas preference in the award
    of Government contracts: Provided, that nothing in this section
    shall prevent the rejection of a bid or offered price which is
    excessive; or
      (d) To reject any bid or offer for materials of foreign origin if
    such rejection is necessary to protect essential national-security
    interests after receiving advice with respect thereto from the
    President or from the Director [now Administrator] of the Federal
    Emergency Management Agency. In providing this advice the Director
    [Administrator] shall be governed by the principle that exceptions
    under this section shall be made only upon a clear showing that the
    payment of a greater differential than the procedures of this
    section generally prescribe is justified by consideration of
    national security.
      Sec. 4. The head of each executive agency shall issue such
    regulations as may be necessary to insure that procurement
    practices under his jurisdiction conform to the provisions of this
    order.
      Sec. 5. This order shall apply only to contracts entered into
    after the date hereof. In any case in which the head of an
    executive agency proposing to purchase domestic materials
    determines that a greater differential than that provided in this
    order between the cost of such materials of domestic origin and
    materials of foreign origin is not unreasonable or that the
    purchase of materials of domestic origin is not inconsistent with
    the public interest, this order shall not apply. A written report
    of the facts of each case in which such a determination is made
    shall be submitted to the President through the Director of the
    Office of Management and Budget by the official making the
    determination within 30 days thereafter.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Transfer
      No contract or order, or any interest therein, shall be
    transferred by the party to whom such contract or order is given to
    any other party, and any such transfer shall cause the annulment of
    the contract or order transferred, so far as the United States is
    concerned. All rights of action, however, for any breach of such
    contract by the contracting parties, are reserved to the United
    States.
    (b) Assignment
      The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply
    in any case in which the moneys due or to become due from the
    United States or from any agency or department thereof, under a
    contract providing for payments aggregating $1,000 or more, are
    assigned to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution,
    including any Federal lending agency, provided:
        (1) That, in the case of any contract entered into after
      October 9, 1940, no claim shall be assigned if it arises under a
      contract which forbids such assignment.
        (2) That, unless otherwise expressly permitted by such
      contract, any such assignment shall cover all amounts payable
      under such contract and not already paid, shall not be made to
      more than one party, and shall not be subject to further
      assignment, except that any such assignment may be made to one
      party as agent or trustee for two or more parties participating
      in such financing.
        (3) That, in the event of any such assignment, the assignee
      thereof shall file written notice of the assignment together with
      a true copy of the instrument of the assignment with - 
          (A) the contracting officer or the head of his department or
        agency;
          (B) the surety or sureties upon the bond or bonds, if any, in
        connection with such contract; and
          (C) the disbursing officer, if any, designated in such
        contract to make payment.
    (c) Validity of assignment
      Notwithstanding any law to the contrary governing the validity of
    assignments, any assignment pursuant to this section shall
    constitute a valid assignment for all purposes.
    (d) Assignee liability
      In any case in which moneys due or to become due under any
    contract are or have been assigned pursuant to this section, no
    liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any
    department or agency thereof, whether arising from or independently
    of such contract, shall create or impose any liability on the part
    of the assignee to make restitution, refund, or repayment to the
    United States of any amount heretofore since July 1, 1950, or
    hereafter received under the assignment.
    (e) Amendment of contract
      Any contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services
    Administration, the Department of Energy, or any other department
    or agency of the United States designated by the President, except
    any such contract under which full payment has been made, may, upon
    a determination of need by the President, provide or be amended
    without consideration to provide that payments to be made to the
    assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract
    shall not be subject to reduction or setoff. Each such
    determination of need shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (f) Assignor liability arising independent of contract
      If a provision described in subsection (e) of this section or a
    provision to the same general effect has been at any time
    heretofore or is hereafter included or inserted in any such
    contract, payments to be made thereafter to an assignee of any
    moneys due or to become due under such contract shall not be
    subject to reduction or setoff for any liability of any nature of
    the assignor to the United States or any department or agency
    thereof which arises independently of such contract, or hereafter

    EX. ORD. NO. 13126. PROHIBITION OF ACQUISITION OF PRODUCTS PRODUCED

      Ex. Ord. No. 13126, June 12, 1999, 64 F.R. 32383, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    continue the executive branch's commitment to fighting abusive
    child labor practices, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section. 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the United States
    Government, consistent with the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1307,
    the Fair Labor Standards Act [of 1938], 29 U.S.C. 201 et. seq., and
    the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act [Walsh-Healey Act], 41 U.S.C.
    35 et seq., that executive agencies shall take appropriate actions
    to enforce the laws prohibiting the manufacture or importation of
    goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or
    manufactured wholly or in part by forced or indentured child labor.
      Sec. 2. Publication of List. Within 120 days after the date of
    this order, the Department of Labor, in consultation and
    cooperation with the Department of the Treasury and the Department
    of State, shall publish in the Federal Register a list of products,
    identified by their country of origin, that those Departments have
    a reasonable basis to believe might have been mined, produced, or
    manufactured by forced or indentured child labor. The Department of
    Labor may conduct hearings to assist in the identification of those
    products.
      Sec. 3. Procurement Regulations. Within 120 days after the date
    of this order, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall
    issue proposed rules to implement the following:
      (a) Required Solicitation Provisions. Each solicitation of offers
    for a contract for the procurement of a product included on the
    list published under section 2 of this order shall include the
    following provisions:
      (1) A provision that requires the contractor to certify to the
    contracting officer that the contractor or, in the case of an
    incorporated contractor, a responsible official of the contractor
    has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or
    indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture
    any product furnished under the contract and that, on the basis of
    those efforts, the contractor is unaware of any such use of child
    labor; and
      (2) A provision that obligates the contractor to cooperate fully
    in providing reasonable access to the contractor's records,
    documents, persons, or premises if reasonably requested by
    authorized officials of the contracting agency, the Department of
    the Treasury, or the Department of Justice, for the purpose of
    determining whether forced or indentured child labor was used to
    mine, produce, or manufacture any product furnished under the
    contract.
      (b) Investigations. Whenever a contracting officer of an
    executive agency has reason to believe that forced or indentured
    child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture a product
    furnished pursuant to a contract subject to the requirements of
    subsection 3(a) of this order, the head of the executive agency
    shall refer the matter for investigation to the Inspector General
    of the executive agency and, as the head of the executive agency or
    the Inspector General determines appropriate, to the Attorney

      Upon his own motion or on application of any person affected by
    any ruling of any agency of the United States in relation to any
    proposal or contract involving any of the provisions of sections 35

    requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the
    production of evidence under oath. Witnesses shall be paid the same

    person to appear before him or representative designated by him, to
    produce evidence if, as, and when so ordered, and to give testimony
    relating to the matter under investigation or in question; and any
    failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by said
    court as a contempt thereof; and shall make findings of fact after
    notice and hearing, which findings shall be conclusive upon all
    agencies of the United States, and if supported by the
    preponderance of the evidence, shall be conclusive in any court of
    the United States; and the Secretary of Labor or authorized

-STATUTE-
      Upon a written finding by the head of the contracting agency or
    department that the inclusion in the proposal or contract of the
    representations or stipulations set forth in section 35 of this
    title will seriously impair the conduct of Government business, the
    Secretary of Labor shall make exceptions in specific cases or
    otherwise when justice or public interest will be served thereby.
    Upon the joint recommendation of the contracting agency and the
    contractor, the Secretary of Labor may modify the terms of an
    existing contract respecting minimum rates of pay and maximum hours
    of labor as he may find necessary and proper in the public interest
    or to prevent injustice and undue hardship. The Secretary of Labor
    may provide reasonable limitations and may make rules and
    regulations allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, and
    exemptions to and from any or all provisions of sections 35 to 45
    of this title respecting minimum rates of pay and maximum hours of
    labor or the extent of the application of said sections to
    contractors, as hereinbefore described. Whenever the Secretary of
    Labor shall permit an increase in the maximum hours of labor
    stipulated in the contract, he shall set a rate of pay for any
    overtime, which rate shall be not less than one and one-half times
    the basic hourly rate received by any employee affected: Provided,
    That whenever in his judgment such course is in the public
    interest, the President is authorized to suspend any or all of the
    representations and stipulations contained in section 35 of this
    title.

      In order to insure uniform and efficient administration of the
    provisions of this chapter, the Administrator of General Services,
    subject to such provisions, by general orders or general
    regulations - 
        (1) shall prescribe policies, principles, methods, procedures,
      and standards to govern the exercise of the authority and
      discretion and the performance of the duties and functions of all
      Government agencies under this chapter; and
        (2) may require or restrict the exercise of any such authority
      and discretion, or the performance of any such duty or function,
      to such extent as he deems necessary to carry out the provisions
      of this chapter.
    (c) Compliance
      The exercise of any authority or discretion and the performance
    of any duty or function, conferred or imposed on any Government
    agency by this chapter, shall be subject to such orders and
    regulations prescribed by the Administrator of General Services
    pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Each Government agency
    shall carry out such orders and regulations of the Administrator of
    General Services expeditiously, and shall issue such regulations
    with respect to its operations and procedures as may be necessary
    to carry out the policies, principles, methods, procedures, and
    standards prescribed by the Administrator of General Services. Any
    Government agency may issue such further regulations not

    The Administrator of General Services shall perform the duties
    imposed upon him through the personnel and facilities of the

    the employment of certified public accountants, qualified cost
    accountants, industrial engineers, appraisers, and other experts
    without regard to "the Classification Act of 1923", were omitted as

    laws inconsistent with the 1949 Act. While section 1106(a) of the
    1949 Act provided that references in other laws to the 1923 Act
    should be held and considered to mean the 1949 Act, it did not have
    the effect of continuing the exceptions contained in this sentence
    because of section 1106(b) which provided that the application of
    the 1949 Act to any position, officer, or employee shall not be
    affected by section 1106(a). The Classification Act of 1949 was
    repealed by Pub. L. 89-554, Sept. 6, 1966, Sec. 8(a), 80 Stat. 632
    (of which section 1 revised and enacted Title 5 into law). Section
    5102 of Title 5 contains the applicability provisions of the 1949
    Act, and section 5103 of Title 5 authorizes the Office of Personnel
    Management to determine the applicability to specific positions and
    employees.

    (b) Establishment of methods and standards
      Each contracting agency shall establish methods and standards,
    suitable to the conditions of various war contractors, for
    determining fair compensation for the termination of war contracts
    on the basis of actual, standard, average, or estimated costs, or
    of a percentage of the contract price based on the estimated
    percentage of completion of work under the terminated contract, or
    on any other equitable basis, as it deems appropriate. To the
    extent that such methods and standards require accounting, they
    shall be adapted, so far as practicable, to the accounting systems
    used by war contractors, if consistent with recognized commercial
    accounting practice.
    (c) Conclusiveness of settlement
      Any contracting agency may settle all or any part of any
    termination claim under any war contract by agreement with the war
    contractor, or by determination of the amount due on the claim or
    part thereof without such agreement, or by any combination of these
    methods. Where any such settlement is made by agreement, the
    settlement shall be final and conclusive, except (1) to the extent
    otherwise agreed in the settlement; (2) for fraud; (3) upon
    renegotiation to eliminate excessive profits under section 1191 of
    Appendix to title 50, unless exempt or exempted under such section;
    or (4) by mutual agreement before or after payment. Where any such
    settlement is made by determination without agreement, it shall
    likewise be final and conclusive, subject to the same exceptions as
    if made by agreement, unless the war contractor appeals or brings
    suit in accordance with section 113 of this title: Provided, That
    no settlement agreement hereunder involving payment to a war
    contractor of an amount in excess of $50,000 (or such lesser amount
    as the Administrator of General Services may from time to time
    determine) shall become binding upon the Government until the
    agreement has been reviewed and approved by a settlement review
    board of three or more members established by the contracting
    agency in the bureau, division, regional or district office, or
    other unit of the contracting agency authorized to make such
    settlement, or in the event of disapproval by the settlement review
    board, unless approved by the head of such bureau, division,
    regional or district office, or other unit. Failure of the
    settlement review board to act upon any settlement within thirty
    days after its submission to the board shall operate as approval by
    the board. The sole function of settlement review boards shall be
    to determine the over-all reasonableness of proposed settlement
    agreements from the point of view of protecting the interests of
    the Government. In determining, for purposes of this subsection,
    whether review of any settlement agreement is required because of
    the amounts involved, no deduction shall be made on account of
    credits for property chargeable to the Government or for advance or
    partial payments, but amounts payable under such settlement
    agreement for completed articles or work at the contract price and
    for the discharge of the termination claims of subcontractors shall
    be deducted.
    (d) Allowable costs
      Except as hereinafter provided, the methods and standards
    established under subsection (b) of this section for determining
    fair compensation for termination claims which are not settled by
    agreement shall be designed to compensate the war contractor fairly
    for the termination of the war contract, taking into account - 
        (1) the direct and indirect manufacturing, selling and
      distribution, administrative and other costs and expenses
      incurred by the war contractor which are reasonably necessary for
      the performance of the war contract and properly allocable to the
      terminated portion thereof under recognized commercial accounting
      practices; and
        (2) reasonable costs and expenses of settling termination
      claims of subcontractors related to the terminated portion of the
      war contract; and
        (3) reasonable accounting, legal, clerical, and other costs and
      expenses incident to termination and settlement of the terminated
      war contract; and
        (4) reasonable costs and expenses of removing, preserving,
      storing and disposing of termination inventories; and
        (5) such allowance for profit on the preparations made and work
      done for the terminated portion of the war contract as is
      reasonable under the circumstances; and
        (6) interest on the termination claim in accordance with
      subsection (f) of this section; and
        (7) the contract price and all amounts otherwise paid or
      payable under the contract.

      The following shall not be included as elements of cost:
        (i) Losses on other contracts, or from sales or exchanges of
      capital assets, fees and other expenses in connection with
      reorganization or recapitalization, antitrust or Federal income-
      tax litigation, or prosecution of Federal income-tax claims or
      other claims against the Government (except as provided in
      paragraph (3) of this subsection); losses on investments;
      provisions for contingencies; and premiums on life insurance
      where the contractor is the beneficiary.
        (ii) The expense of conversion of the contractor's facilities
      to uses other than the performance of the contract.
        (iii) Expenses due to the negligence or willful failure of the
      contractor to discontinue with reasonable promptness the
      incurring of expenses after the effective date of the termination
      notice.
        (iv) Costs incurred in respect to facilities, materials, or
      services purchased or work done in excess of the reasonable
      quantitative requirements of the entire contract.

      The failure specifically to mention in this subsection any item
    of cost is not intended to imply that it should be allowed or
    disallowed. The Administrator of General Services may interpret the
    provisions of this subsection and may provide for the inclusion or
    exclusion of other costs in accordance with recognized commercial
    accounting practice.
      Where the small size of claims or the nature of production or
    performance or other factors make it impracticable to apply the
    principles stated in this subsection to any class of settlements
    which are subject to this subsection, the contracting agencies may
    establish alternative methods and standards for determining fair
    compensation for that class of termination claims. The aggregate
    amount of compensation allowed in accordance with this subsection
    (excluding amounts allowed under paragraphs (3) and (4) of this
    subsection) shall not exceed the total contract price reduced by
    the amount of payments otherwise made or to be made under the
    contract.
    (e) Settlement by agreement
      In order to carry out the objectives of this chapter, termination
    claims shall be settled by agreement to the maximum extent feasible
    and the methods and standards established under subsection (b) of
    this section shall be designed to facilitate such settlements. To
    the extent that he deems it practicable to do so without impeding
    expeditious settlements, the Administrator of General Services
    shall require the contracting agencies to take into account the
    factors enumerated in subsection (d) of this section in
    establishing methods and standards for determining fair
    compensation in the settlement of termination claims by agreement.
    (f) Interest
      Each contracting agency shall allow and pay interest on the
    amount due and unpaid from time to time on any termination claim
    under a prime contract at the rate of 2 1/2  per centum per annum
    for the period beginning thirty days after the date fixed for
    termination and ending with the date of final payment, except that
    (1) if the prime contractor unreasonably delays the settlement of
    his claim, interest shall not accrue for the period of such delay,
    (2) if interest for the period after termination on any advance
    payment or loan, made or guaranteed by the Government, has been
    waived for the benefit of the contractor, the amount of the
    interest so waived allocable to the terminated contract or the
    terminated part of the contract shall be deducted from the interest
    otherwise payable hereunder, and (3) if after delivery of findings
    by a contracting agency, the contractor appeals or sues as provided
    in section 113 of this title, interest shall not accrue after the
    thirtieth day following the delivery of the findings on any amount
    allowed by such findings, unless such amount is increased upon such
    appeal or suit. In approving, ratifying, authorizing, or making
    termination settlements with subcontractors, each contracting
    agency shall allow interest on the termination claim of the
    subcontractor on the same basis and subject to the same conditions
    as are applicable to a prime contractor.
    (g) Amendment of contracts
      Where any war contract does not provide for or provides against
    such fair compensation for its termination, the contracting agency,
    either before or after its termination, shall amend such war
    contract by agreement with the war contractor, or shall authorize,
    approve, or ratify an amendment of such war contract by the parties
    thereto, to provide for such fair compensation.

    TITLE 41 - PUBLIC CONTRACTS
    CHAPTER 2 - TERMINATION OF WAR CONTRACTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 107. Settlement of subcontractors' claims

-STATUTE-
    (a) Conclusiveness of settlement
      Where, in connection with the settlement of any termination claim
    by a contracting agency, any war contractor makes settlements of
    the termination claims of his subcontractors, the contracting
    agency shall limit or omit its review of such settlements with
    subcontractors to the maximum extent compatible with the public
    interest. Any contracting agency (1) may approve, ratify, or
    authorize such settlements with subcontractors upon such evidence,
    terms, and conditions as it deems proper; (2) shall vary the scope
    and intensity of its review of such settlements according to the
    reliability of the war contractor, the size, number, and complexity
    of such claims, and other relevant factors; and (3) shall authorize
    war contractors to make such settlements with subcontractors
    without review by the contracting agency, whenever the reliability
    of the war contractor, the amount or nature of the claims, or other
    reasons appear to the contracting agency to justify such action.
    Any such settlement of a subcontract approved, ratified, or
    authorized by a contracting agency shall be final and conclusive as
    to the amount due to the same extent as a settlement under
    subsection (c) of section 106 of this title, and no war contractor
    shall be liable to the United States on account of any amounts paid
    thereon except for his own fraud.
    (b) Supervision of payments to war contractors
      Whenever any contracting agency is satisfied of the inability of
    a war contractor to meet his obligations it shall exercise
    supervision or control over payments to the war contractor on
    account of termination claims of subcontractors of such war
    contractor to such extent and in such manner as it deems necessary
    or desirable for the purpose of assuring the receipt of the benefit
    of such payments by the subcontractors.
    (c) Group settlements
      The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe policies
    and methods for the settlement as a group, or otherwise, by any
    contracting agency of some or all of the termination claims of a
    war contractor under war contracts with one or more (1) bureaus or
    divisions within a contracting agency, (2) contracting agencies, or
    (3) prime contractors and subcontractors, to the extent he deems
    such action necessary or desirable for expeditious and equitable
    settlement of such claims. After consulting with the contracting
    agencies concerned, the Administrator of General Services may
    provide for assigning any war contractor to a contracting agency
    for such settlement, and such agency shall have authority to
    settle, on behalf of any other contracting agency, some or all of
    the termination claims of such war contractor.
    (d) Direct settlement by contracting agency
      Any contracting agency may settle directly termination claims of
    subcontractors to the extent that it deems such action necessary or
    desirable for the expeditious and equitable settlement of such
    claims. In making such termination settlements any contracting
    agency may discharge the claim of the subcontractor by payment or
    may purchase such claim, and may agree to assume, or indemnify the
    subcontractor against, any claims by any person in connection with
    such claim or the termination settlement. Any contracting agency
    undertaking to settle the termination claim of any subcontractor
    shall deliver to the subcontractor and the war contractor liable to
    him written notice stating its acceptance of responsibility for
    settling his claim and the conditions applicable thereto, which may
    include the release, or assignment to the contracting agency, of
    his claim against the war contractor liable to him; upon consent
    thereto by the subcontractor, the Government shall become liable
    for the settlement of his claims upon the conditions specified in
    the notice.
    (e) Amount of settlement
      Any contracting agency may make settlements with subcontractors
    in accordance with any of the provisions of this chapter without
    regard to any limitation on the amount payable by the Government to
    the prime contractor.
    (f) Equitable payments
      If any contracting agency determines that in the circumstances of
    a particular case equity and good conscience require fair
    compensation for the termination of a war contract to be paid to a
    subcontractor who has been deprived of and cannot otherwise
    reasonably secure such fair compensation, the contracting agency
    concerned may pay such compensation to him although such
    compensation already has been included and paid as part of a
    settlement with another war contractor.

    TITLE 41 - PUBLIC CONTRACTS
    CHAPTER 2 - TERMINATION OF WAR CONTRACTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 108. Interim financing

-STATUTE-
    (a) Prime contractors
      It is the policy of the Government, and it shall be the
    responsibility of the contracting agencies and the Administrator of
    General Services, in accordance with and subject to the provisions
    of this chapter, to provide war contractors having any termination
    claim or claims, pending their settlement, with adequate interim
    financing, within thirty days after proper application therefor.
    (b) Method of financing; amounts payable
      Each contracting agency shall, to the greatest extent it deems
    practicable, make available interim financing through loans and
    discounts, and commitments and guaranties in connection therewith,
    in contemplation of or related to termination of war contracts.
    Where interim financing is made by advance payments or partial
    payments, it shall, insofar as practicable, consist of the
    following:
        (1) An amount equal to 100 per centum of the amount payable, at
      the contract price, on account of acceptable items completed
      prior to the termination date under the terms of the contract, or
      completed thereafter with the approval of the contracting agency;
      plus
        (2) An amount equal to 90 per centum of the cost of raw
      materials, purchased parts, supplies, direct labor, and
      manufacturing overhead allocable to the terminated portion of the
      war contract; plus
        (3) A reasonable percentage of other allowable costs, including
      administrative overhead, allocable to the terminated portion of
      the war contract not included in the foregoing; plus
        (4) Such additional amounts, if any, as the contracting agency
      deems necessary to provide the war contractor with adequate
      interim financing.
        (5) In lieu of the costs referred to in clauses (2) and (3) of
      this subsection, where a detailed ascertainment of such costs is
      not suitable to the conditions of any war contractor and is apt
      to cause delay in the obtaining of interim financing by him, that
      portion of such interim financing shall be equal to an amount not
      greater than 90 per centum of the estimated costs which are
      allocable to the terminated part or parts of the war contract or
      group of war contracts, and are ascertained in accordance with
      such methods and standards as the Administrator of General
      Services shall prescribe.
        (6) There shall be deducted from the amount of such interim
      financing any unliquidated balances of advance and partial
      payments theretofore made to such war contractor, which are
      allocable to the terminated war contract or the terminated part
      of the war contract.
    (c) Evidence to support financing
      The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe (1) the
    types of estimates, certificates, or other evidence to be required
    to support such interim financing; (2) the terms and conditions
    upon which such interim financing shall be made including the use
    of standard forms for agreements with respect to such interim
    financing to the extent practicable; (3) the classes of cases in
    which such interim financing shall be refused; and (4) such methods
    of supervision and control over such interim financing as he deems
    necessary or desirable to assure adequate and speedy interim
    financing to subcontractors of the war contractor.
    (d) Penalty for overstatement of claims
      In case of an overstatement by any war contractor of the amount
    due on his termination claim or claims in connection with any
    interim financing under this chapter, such contractor shall pay to
    the United States, as a penalty, an amount equal to 6 per centum of
    the amount of the overstatement, but the Administrator of General
    Services may suspend or modify any such penalty if in his opinion
    the imposition thereof would be inequitable. Any penalty may be
    deducted from any amounts due the war contractor upon such
    termination claim or claims, or otherwise, or may be collected from
    the war contractor by suit. The obligation to pay any penalty
    imposed and to repay any interim financing made or assumed by the
    United States under this chapter shall constitute a debt due to the
    United States within the meaning of section 3713(a) of title 31.
    (e) Advance payments as part of termination settlement
      Any contracting agency may allow any advance payments, previously
    made or authorized by it in connection with the performance of a
    war contract, to be used for payments and expenses related to the
    termination settlement of such contract, upon such terms and
    conditions as it deems necessary or appropriate to protect the
    interest of the Government.
    (f) Liquidation of loans, etc., prior to final settlement
      No interim financing shall be made by any contracting agency
    under this chapter unless the terms of such financing provide for
    the liquidation by the war contractor of all loans, discounts,
    advance payments, or partial payments thereunder not later than the
    time of final payment of the amount due on the settlement of the
    termination claim or claims of the war contractor involved or such
    time thereafter as the contracting agency deems necessary for the
    liquidation of such interim financing in an orderly manner.
    (g) Settlement of claims; validation of prior financing
      Any contracting agency may settle, upon such terms and conditions
    as it deems proper, any claim or obligation due by or to the
    Government arising from or related to any interim financing made,
    acquired, or authorized by it. Any interim financing made,
    acquired, or authorized by any contracting agency before July 21,
    1944, shall be valid to the extent it would be authorized under the
    provisions of this chapter if made after its effective date.

      payments, interest, liability of war contractor

-STATUTE-
      (a) Any contracting agency may make advance or partial payments
    to any war contractor on account of any termination claim or
    claims, and may authorize, approve, or ratify any such advance or
    partial payments by any war contractor to his subcontractors, upon
    such conditions as it deems necessary to insure compliance with the
    provisions of subsection (b) of this section. Each contracting
    agency shall make final payments from time to time on partial
    settlements or on settlements fixing a minimum amount due before
    complete settlement, or as tentative payments before any settlement
    of the claim or claims.
      (b) Where any such advance or partial payment is made to any war
    contractor by any contracting agency or by another war contractor
    under this section, except a final payment on a partial settlement,
    any amount in excess of the amount finally determined to be due on
    the termination claim shall be treated as a loan from the
    Government to the war contractor receiving it, and shall be payable
    upon demand together with a penalty computed at the rate of 6 per
    centum per annum, for the period from the date such excess advance
    or partial payment is received to the date on which such excess is
    repaid or extinguished. Where the advance or partial payment was
    made by a war contractor and authorized, approved, or ratified by
    any contracting agency, the war contractor making it shall not be
    liable for any such excess payment in the absence of fraud on his
    part and shall receive payment or credit from the Government for
    the amount of such excess payment.

        (1) to enter into contracts with any Federal Reserve bank, or
      other public or private financing institution, guaranteeing such
      financing institution against loss of principal or interest on
      loans, discounts, or advances or on commitments in connection
      therewith, which such financing institution may make to any war
      contractor or to any person who is or has been engaged in
      performing any operation deemed by such contracting agency to be
      connected with or related to war production, for the purpose of
      financing such war contractor or other person in connection with
      or in contemplation of the termination of one or more such war
      contracts or operations; and
        (2) to make, enter into contracts to make, or to participate
      with any Government agency, any Federal Reserve bank or public or
      private financing institution in making loans, discounts, or

    to assign, some or all of the rights of such war contractor or
    other person in connection with the termination of such war
    contracts or operations, or in such other manner as the contracting
    agency may prescribe.
    (c) Federal Reserve bank as fiscal agent
      Subject to such regulations as the Board of Governors of the
    Federal Reserve System may prescribe with the approval of the

-STATUTE-
    (a) Advance notice; prime contracts
      In order to facilitate the efficient use of materials, manpower,
    and facilities for war and civilian purposes, each contracting
    agency - 
        (1) shall provide its prime contractors with notice of
      termination of their prime contracts as far in advance of the
      cessation of work thereunder as is feasible and consistent with
      the national security without permitting unneeded production or
      performance;
        (2) shall establish procedures whereby prime contractors shall
      provide affected subcontractors with immediate notice of
      termination; and
        (3) shall permit the continuation of some or all of the work
      under a terminated prime contract whenever the agency deems that
      such continuation will benefit the Government or is necessary to
      avoid substantial injury to the plant or property.
    (b) Cessation of work without termination
      Whenever a contracting agency hereafter directs a prime
    contractor to cease or suspend all or a substantial part of the
    work under a prime contract, without terminating the contract,
    then, unless the contract provides otherwise, (1) the contracting
    agency shall compensate the contractor for reasonable costs and
    expenses resulting from such cessation or suspension, and (2) if
    the cessation or suspension extends for thirty days or more, the
    contractor may elect to treat it as a termination by delivering
    written notice of his election so to do to the contracting agency,
    at any time before the contracting agency directs the prime
    contractor to resume work under the contract.
    (c) Authority of Administrator of General Services; classes of
      contracts
      The Administrator of General Services shall have no authority

    TITLE 41 - PUBLIC CONTRACTS
    CHAPTER 2 - TERMINATION OF WAR CONTRACTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 112. Removal and storage of materials

-STATUTE-
    (a) Termination inventory
      It is the policy of the Government, upon the termination of any
    war contract, to assure the expeditious removal from the plant of
    the war contractor of the termination inventory not to be retained
    or sold by the war contractor.
    (b) Statement on material of inventory
      Any war contractor may submit to the contracting agency concerned
    or to any other Government agency designated by the Administrator
    of General Services, one or more statements showing the materials
    which such war contractor claims to be termination inventory under
    one or more war contracts and desires to have removed by the
    Government. Such statements shall be prepared in such form and
    detail, shall be submitted in such manner, through the prime
    contractor or otherwise, and shall be supported by such
    certificates or other data, as may be prescribed under this
    chapter.
    (c) Removal and storage by Government agency
      Within sixty days after the submission of any such statement by a
    war contractor, or such shorter period as may be prescribed under
    this chapter, or within such longer period as the war contractor
    may agree, the Government agency concerned (1) shall arrange, upon
    such terms and conditions as may be agreed, for the storage by the
    war contractor on his own premises or elsewhere of all such claimed
    termination inventory which the war contractor does not retain or
    dispose of, except any part which may be determined not to be
    allocable to the terminated war contract or contracts, or (2) shall
    remove from the plant or plants of the war contractor all of such
    claimed termination inventory not retained, disposed of, or stored
    by the war contractor or determined not to be allocable to the
    terminated war contract or contracts.
    (d) Removal and storage by war contractor
      Upon the failure of the Government so to arrange for storage by
    the war contractor or to remove any termination inventory within
    the period specified under subsection (c) of this section, the war
    contractor, subject to regulations prescribed under this chapter,
    may remove some or all of such termination inventory from his plant
    or plants and may store it on his own premises or elsewhere for the
    account and at the risk and expense of the Government, using
    reasonable care for its transportation and preservation. If any war
    contractor intends so to remove any claimed termination inventory,
    he shall deliver to the Government agency concerned written notice
    of the date fixed for removal and a statement showing the
    quantities and condition of the materials so to be removed,
    certified on behalf of the war contractor to have been prepared in
    accordance with a concurrent physical inventory of such materials.
    Such notice and statement shall be delivered at least twenty days
    in advance of the date fixed for removal and may be delivered
    before or after the expiration of the period specified under
    subsection (c) of this section. If the Government agency fails to
    check such materials, at or before the time of their removal by the
    war contractor, a certificate of the war contractor specifying the
    materials shown on such statement which were so removed, and filed
    with the Government agency concerned within thirty days after the
    date fixed for removal, shall constitute prima facie evidence
    against the United States as to the quantities and condition of the
    materials so removed, and the fact of their removal.
    (e) Acquisition by Government agency of inventory material;
      liability
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, but subject to
    subsection (h) of this section, the contracting agency concerned or
    the Administrator of General Services, or any Government agency
    designated by him, on behalf of the United States, may, by the
    exercise of any contract rights or otherwise, acquire and take
    possession of any termination inventory of any war contractor, and
    any materials removed by the Government or stored for its account
    under subsections (c) and (d) of this section, whether or not such
    materials are finally determined not to constitute termination
    inventory. With respect to any such materials, the Government shall
    be liable to any war contractor concerned only for their return to
    such war contractor or for their disposal value at the time of
    their removal or for the proceeds realized by the Government from
    their disposal, at the election of the Government agency concerned,
    unless the Government agency and the war contractor agree or have
    agreed on a different basis. Any amount so paid or payable to a war
    contractor for materials allocable to a terminated war contract
    shall be credited against the termination claim under such contract
    but shall not otherwise affect the amount due on the claim, unless
    the Government agency concerned and the war contractor agree or
    have agreed otherwise. Any materials to which the Administrator of
    General Services takes title under this section shall be delivered
    for disposal to any appropriate Government agency authorized to
    make such disposal.
    (f) Postponement or delay of termination settlement
      No contracting agency shall postpone or delay any termination
    settlement beyond the period specified in subsection (c) of this
    section for the purpose of awaiting disposal by the war contractor
    or the Government of any termination inventory reported in
    accordance with subsection (b) of this section.
    (g) Government-owned machinery
      Whenever any war contractor no longer requires, for the
    performance of any war contract, any Government-owned machinery,
    tools, or equipment installed in his plant for the performance of
    one or more war contracts, the Government agency concerned, upon
    written demand by the war contractor, and within sixty days after
    such demand or such other period as may be prescribed under this
    chapter, and upon such conditions as may be so prescribed, shall
    remove or provide for the removal of such machinery, tools, or
    equipment from such plant, unless the Government agency concerned
    and the war contractor, by facilities contract or otherwise, have
    made or make other provisions for the retention, storage,
    maintenance, or disposition of such machinery, tools or equipment.
    The Government agency concerned may waive or release on behalf of
    the United States any obligation of the war contractor with respect
    to such machinery, tools, or equipment upon such terms and
    conditions as the agency deems appropriate. Upon the failure of the
    Government so to remove or provide for removal of any such
    machinery, tools, or equipment, the war contractor, subject to
    regulations prescribed under this chapter, may remove all or part
    of such machinery, tools, or equipment from his plant and may store
    it on his own premises or elsewhere, for the account and at the
    risk and expense of the Government, using reasonable care for its
    transportation and preservation.
    (h) Limitation on Government acquisition of inventories
      Nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of
    the Department of the Army, Department of the Air Force, Navy
    Department, or the Department of Transportation, respectively, to
    take over any termination inventories and to retain them for their
    use for any purpose or to dispose of such termination inventories
    for the purpose of war production, or to authorize any war
    contractor to retain or dispose of such termination inventories for
    the purpose of war production.
    (i) Removal and storage by war contractor at own risk
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the removal
    and storage of any termination inventory by any war contractor, at
    his own risk, at any time after termination of any war contract to
    which it is allocable.

    TITLE 41 - PUBLIC CONTRACTS
    CHAPTER 2 - TERMINATION OF WAR CONTRACTS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 113. Appeals

-STATUTE-
    (a) Failure to settle claims by agreement; preparation of findings;
      notice to war contractor
      Whenever the contracting agency responsible for settling any
    termination claim has not settled the claim by agreement or has so
    settled only a part of the claim, (1) the contracting agency at any
    time may determine the amount due on such claim or such unsettled
    part, and prepare written findings indicating the basis of the
    determination, and deliver a copy of such findings to the war
    contractor, or (2) if the termination claim has been submitted in
    the manner and substantially the form prescribed under this
    chapter, the contracting agency, upon written demand by the war
    contractor for such findings, shall determine the amount due on the
    claim or unsettled part and prepare and deliver such findings to
    the war contractor within ninety days after the receipt by the
    agency of such demand. In preparing such findings, the contracting
    agency may require the war contractor to furnish such information
    and to submit to such audits as may be reasonably necessary for
    that purpose. Within thirty days after the delivery of any such
    findings, the contracting agency shall pay to the war contractor at
    least 90 per centum of the amount thereby determined to be due,
    after deducting the amount of any outstanding interim financing
    applicable thereto.
    (b) Rights of war contractor
      Whenever any war contractor is aggrieved by the findings of a
    contracting agency on his claim or part thereof or by its failure
    to make such findings in accordance with subsection (a) of this
    section, he may bring suit against the United States for such claim
    or such part thereof, in the United States Court of Federal Claims
    or in a United States district court, in accordance with sections
    1346, 2401, and 2402 of title 28, except that, if the contracting
    agency is the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or any
    corporation organized pursuant to the Reconstruction Finance
    Corporation Act, or any corporation owned or controlled by the
    United States, the suit shall be brought against such corporation
    in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with existing
    law.
    (c) Procedure
      Any proceeding under subsection (b) of this section shall be
    governed by the following conditions:
        (1) When any contracting agency provides a procedure within the
      agency for protest against such findings or for other appeal
      therefrom by the war contractor, the war contractor, before
      proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, (i) in his
      discretion may resort to such procedure within the time specified
      in his contract or, if no time is specified, within thirty days
      after the delivery to him of the findings; and (ii) shall resort
      to such procedure for protest or other appeal to the extent
      required by the Administrator of General Services, but failure of
      the contracting agency to act on any such required protest or
      appeal within thirty days shall operate as a refusal by the
      agency to modify its findings. Any revision of the findings by
      the contracting agency, upon protest or appeal within the agency,
      shall be treated as the findings of the agency for the purpose of
      appeal or suit under subsection (b) of this section.
      Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract, no
      war contractor shall be required to protest or appeal from such
      findings within the contracting agency except in accordance with
      this paragraph.
        (2) A war contractor may initiate proceedings in accordance
      with subsection (b) of this section (i) within ninety days after
      delivery to him of the findings by the contracting agency, or
      (ii) in case of protests or appeal within the agency, within
      ninety days after the determination of such protest or appeal, or
      (iii) in case of failure to deliver such findings, within one
      year after his demand therefor. If he does not initiate such
      proceedings within the time specified, he shall be precluded
      thereafter from initiating any proceedings in accordance with
      subsection (b) of this section, and the findings of the
      contracting agency shall be final and conclusive, or if no
      findings were made, he shall be deemed to have waived such
      termination claim.
        (3) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in any war contract,
      the court shall not be bound by the findings of the contracting
      agency, but shall treat such findings as prima facie correct, and
      the burden shall be on the war contractor to establish that the
      amount due on his claim or part thereof exceeds the amount
      allowed by the findings of the contracting agency. Whenever the
      court finds that the war contractor failed to negotiate in good
      faith with the contracting agency for the settlement of his claim
      or part thereof before appeal or suit thereon, or failed to
      furnish to the agency any information reasonably requested by it
      regarding his termination claim or part thereof, or failed to
      prosecute diligently any protest or appeal required to be taken
      under subsection (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the court (i) may
      refuse to receive in evidence any information not submitted to
      the contracting agency; (ii) may deny interest on the claim or
      part thereof for such period as it deems proper; or (iii) may
      remand the case to the contracting agency for further proceedings
      upon such terms as the court may prescribe. Unless the case is
      remanded, the court shall enter the appropriate award or judgment
      on the basis of the law and facts, and may increase or decrease
      the amount allowed by the findings of the contracting agency.
        (4) Any such proceedings shall not affect the authority of the
      contracting agency concerned to make a settlement of the
      termination claim, or any part thereof, by agreement with the war
      contractor at any time before such proceedings are concluded.
    (d) Omitted
    (e) Arbitration
      The contracting agency responsible for settling any claim and the
    war contractor asserting the claim, by agreement, may submit all or
    any part of the termination claim to arbitration, without regard to
    the amount in dispute. Such arbitration proceedings shall be
    governed by the provisions of United States Arbitration Act to the
    same extent as if authorized by an effective agreement in writing
    between the Government and the war contractor. Any such arbitration
    award shall be final and conclusive upon the United States to the
    same extent as a settlement under subsection (c) of section 106 of
    this title, but shall not be subject to approval by any settlement
    review board.
    (f) Conclusiveness of decisions
      Whenever any dispute exists between any war contractor and a
    subcontractor regarding any termination claim, either of them, by
    agreement with the other, may submit the dispute to a contracting
    agency for mediation or arbitration whenever authorized by the
    agency or required by the Administrator of General Services.
      Any award or decision in such proceedings shall be final and
    conclusive as to the parties so submitting any such dispute and
    shall not be questioned by the United States in settling any
    related claim, in the absence of fraud or collusion.

      ABOLITION OF APPEALS BOARD; TERMINATION OF APPEALS; NO FURTHER

      Act July 14, 1952, ch. 739, 66 Stat. 627, provided: "That the
    Appeal Board established under section 13(d) of the Contract
    Settlement Act of 1944 [41 U.S.C. 113(d)] is hereby abolished:
    Provided, however, That said abolition shall not become effective
    until six months after the enactment of this Act [July 14, 1952] or
    such later date, nor more than nine months after the enactment of
    this Act, as may be fixed by written order of the Director of
    Contract Settlement published in the Federal Register. Such an
    order shall be made only in case the Director finds that it is
    impracticable for the Appeal Board to dispose of its pending
    business before the date fixed for abolition of the Board by this
    Act or a previous order of the Director. No such order shall be
    made less than thirty days prior to the date theretofore fixed for
    abolition of the Appeal Board.
      "Sec. 2. (a) Upon the effective date of the abolition of the
    Appeal Board all appeals and disputes pending therein shall be
    terminated without prejudice and the right of the parties to pursue
    such other remedies as are provided by law shall not be affected
    thereby.
      "(b) In any such terminated appeal, timely initiated in the

    pursuant to section 13(b)(2) of the Contract Settlement Act of 1944
    [41 U.S.C. 113(b)(2)] shall have expired or would expire within

    Board, the period within which proceedings may be initiated in
    accordance with the said section shall be extended to sixty days
    after said effective date.
      "(c) Effective thirty days after the enactment of this Act [July
    14, 1952] no further appeals or submitted disputes shall be
    accepted for determination by said Appeal Board.
      "(d) Where an attempt is erroneously made to file an appeal with
    the Appeal Board after the time limited therefor by section 1(c) of
    this Act but prior to the effective date of the abolition of the
    Appeal Board, said Board shall forthwith return the papers to the
    person therein named as appellant together with a notice in writing
    that, pursuant to the terms of section 1(c) of this Act, it can no
    longer accept such an appeal. Where such an attempt is made in good
    faith and the appeal would, except for the provisions of section
    1(c) of this Act, have been timely and the period for pursuit of
    any other remedy pursuant to section 13(b)(2) of the Contract
    Settlement Act of 1944 [41 U.S.C. 113(b)(2)] expires or would

-STATUTE-
    (a) Appointment of auditors
      For the purpose of expediting the adjudication of termination
    claims, the United States Court of Federal Claims is authorized to
    appoint not more than ten auditors.
    (b) Procedure
      The United States Court of Federal Claims, on motion of either of
    the parties, or on its own motion, may summon any and all persons
    with legal capacity to be sued to appear as a party or parties in
    any suit or proceeding of any nature whatsoever pending in said
    court to assert and defend their interests, if any, in such suits
    or proceedings, within such period of time prior to judgment as the
    United States Court of Federal Claims shall prescribe. If the name
    and address of any such person is known or can be ascertained by
    reasonable diligence, and if he resides within the jurisdiction of
    the United States, he shall be summoned to appear by personal
    service; but if any such person resides outside of the jurisdiction
    of the United States, or is unknown, or if for any other good and
    sufficient reason appearing to the court personal service cannot be
    had, he may be summoned by publication, under such rules as the
    court may adopt, together with a copy of the summons mailed by
    registered mail to such person's last known address. The United
    States Court of Federal Claims may, upon motion of the Attorney
    General, in any suit or proceeding where there may be any number of
    persons having possible interests therein, notify such persons to
    appear to assert and defend such interests. Upon failure so to
    appear, any and all claims or interests in claims of any such
    person against the United States, in respect of the subject matter
    of such suit or proceeding, shall forever be barred and the court
    shall have jurisdiction to enter judgment pro confesso upon any
    claim or contingent claim asserted on behalf of the United States
    against any person who, having been duly served with summons, fails
    to respond thereto, to the same extent and with like effect as if
    such person had appeared and had admitted the truth of all
    allegations made on behalf of the United States. Upon appearance by
    any person pursuant to any such summons or notice, the case as to
    such person shall, for all purposes, be treated as if an
    independent proceeding has been instituted by such person pursuant
    to sections 1491, 1496, 1501, 1503, and 2501 of title 28, and as if
    such independent proceeding had then been consolidated, for
    purposes of trial and determination, with the case in respect of
    which the summons or notice was issued, except that the United
    States shall not be heard upon any counterclaims, claims for
    damages or other demands whatsoever against such person, other than
    claims and contingent claims for the recovery of money hereafter
    paid by the United States in respect of the transaction or matter
    which constitutes the subject matter of such case, unless and until
    such person shall assert therein a claim, or an interest in a
    claim, against the United States, and the United States Court of
    Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to adjudicate, as between
    any and all adverse claimants, their respective several interests
    in any matter in suit and to award several judgments in accordance
    therewith.
    (c) Jurisdiction
      The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Federal Claims
    shall not be affected by this chapter except to the extent
    necessary to give effect to this chapter, and no person shall
    recover judgment on any claim, or on any interest in any claim, in
    said court which such person would not have had a right to assert
    in said court if this section had not been enacted.

    contractor or other person as an advance, partial or final payment
    on any termination claim, or pursuant to any loan, guaranty, or
    agreement for the purchase of any loan, or any commitment in
    connection therewith, entered into by the Government, no officer or

-STATUTE-
    (a) Lack of formalized contract
      Where any person has arranged to furnish or furnished to a
    contracting agency or to a war contractor any materials, services,
    or facilities related to the prosecution of the war, without a
    formal contract, relying in good faith upon the apparent authority
    of an officer or agent of a contracting agency, written or oral
    instructions, or any other request to proceed from a contracting
    agency, the contracting agency shall pay such person fair
    compensation therefor.
    (b) Technical defects or omissions
      Whenever any formal or technical defect or omission in any prime
    contract, or in any grant of authority to an officer or agent of a
    contracting agency who ordered any materials, services, and
    facilities might invalidate the contract or commitment, the
    contracting agency (1) shall not take advantage of such defect or
    omission; (2) shall amend, confirm, or ratify such contract or
    commitment without consideration in order to cure such defect or
    omission; and (3) shall make a fair settlement of any obligation
    thereby created or incurred by such agency, whether expressed or
    implied, in fact or in law, or in the nature of an implied or quasi
    contract.
    (c) Failure to settle
      Where a contracting agency fails to settle by agreement any claim
    asserted under this section, the dispute shall be subject to the
    provisions of section 113 of this title.
    (d) Formalization of obligations; termination date for filing
      claims
      The Administrator of General Services shall require each
    contracting agency to formalize all such obligations and
    commitments within such period as the Administrator of General
    Services deems appropriate. No person shall be entitled to recover
    compensation, to receive a settlement of any alleged obligation, or
    to obtain the benefit of any amendment, confirmation, ratification,
    or formalization of any alleged contract or commitment under the
    provisions of subsections (a), (b), (c), or (d) of this section,
    unless such person shall, on or before one hundred and eighty days

-STATUTE-
    (a) Records and forms
      The Administrator of General Services shall establish policies
    for such supervision and review within the contracting agencies of
    termination settlements and interim financing as he deems necessary
    and appropriate to prevent and detect fraud and to assure
    uniformity in administration and to provide for expeditious
    settlements. For this purpose he shall prescribe such records to be
    prepared by the contracting agencies and by war contractors as he
    deems necessary in connection with such settlements and interim
    financing. He shall seek to reduce the amount of record keeping,
    reporting, and accounting in connection with the settlement of
    termination claims and interim financing to the minimum compatible
    with the reasonable protection of the public interest. Each
    contracting agency shall prescribe forms for use by war contractors
    in connection with termination settlements and interim financing to
    the extent it deems necessary and feasible.
    (b) Repealed. Oct. 31, 1951, ch. 654, Sec. 1(111), 65 Stat. 705
    (c) Advance notice on cut-backs
      The Administrator of General Services, by regulation, shall
    provide for making available to any interested Government agency
    such advance notice and other information on cut-backs in war
    production resulting from terminations or failures to renew or
    extend war contracts, as he deems necessary and appropriate.
    (d) Investigations
      The Administrator of General Services shall make such
    investigations as he deems necessary or desirable in connection
    with termination settlements and interim financing. For this
    purpose he may utilize the facilities of any existing agencies and
    if he determines that the facilities of existing agencies are
    inadequate, he may establish a unit in the General Services
    Administration to supplement and facilitate the work of existing
    agencies. He shall report to the Department of Justice any
    information received by him indicating any fraudulent practices,
    for appropriate action.
    (e) Certification of fraudulent settlements to Department of
      Justice
      Whenever any contracting agency or the Administrator of General
    Services believes that any settlement was induced by fraud, the
    agency or Administrator of General Services shall report the facts
    to the Department of Justice. Thereupon, (1) the Department of
    Justice shall make an investigation to determine whether such
    settlement was induced by fraud, and (2) until the Department of
    Justice notifies the contracting agency that in its opinion the
    facts do not support the belief that the settlement was induced by
    fraud, the contracting agency, by set-off or otherwise, may
    withhold, from amounts owing to the war contractor by the United
    States under such settlement or otherwise, the amount of the
    settlement, or the portion thereof, which, in its opinion, was
    affected by the fraud. In any such case the Department of Justice
    shall take such action as it deems appropriate to recover payments
    made to such war contractor.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Limitation
      Each contracting agency shall have authority, notwithstanding any
    provisions of law other than contained in this chapter, (1) to make
    any contract necessary and appropriate to carry out the provisions
    of this chapter; (2) to amend by agreement any existing contract,
    either before or after notice of its termination, on such terms and
    to such extent as it deems necessary and appropriate to carry out
    the provisions of this chapter; and (3) in settling any termination
    claim, to agree to assume, or indemnify the war contractor against,
    any claims by any person in connection with such termination claims
    or settlement. This subsection shall not limit or affect in any way
    any authority of any contracting agency under the First War Powers
    Act, 1941, or under any other statute.
    (b) Evidence required; conclusiveness of determinations
      Any contracting agency may prescribe the amount and kind of
    evidence required to identify any person as a war contractor, or
    any contract, agreement, or purchase order as a war contract for
    any of the purposes of this chapter. Any determination so made that
    any person is a war contractor, or that any contract, agreement, or
    purchase order is a war contract, shall be final and conclusive for
    any of the purposes of this chapter.
    (c) Appropriations
      There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
    necessary for administering the provisions of this chapter.
    (d) Validation of prior settlements
      All policies and procedures relating to termination of war
    contracts, termination settlements, and interim financing,
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or any contracting
    agency, in effect on July 21, 1944, and not inconsistent with this
    chapter, shall remain in full force and effect unless and until
    superseded by the Administrator of General Services in accordance
    with this chapter, or by regulations of the contracting agency not
    inconsistent with this chapter or the policies prescribed by the
    Administrator of General Services.
    (e) Impairment of contract
      Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impair or modify any
    war contract or any term or provision of any war contract or any
    assignment of any claim under a war contract, without the consent
    of the parties thereto, if the war contract, or the term,
    provision, or assignment thereof, is otherwise valid.
    (f) Aid to war contractors
      Any contracting agency may authorize or direct its officers and
    employees, as a part of their official duties, to advise, aid, and
    assist war contractors in preparing and presenting termination
    claims, in obtaining interim financing, and in related matters, to
    such extent as it deems desirable. Such advice, aid, or assistance
    shall not constitute a violation of section 205 of title 18 or of
    any other law, provided the officer or employee does not receive
    therefor benefit or compensation of any kind, directly or
    indirectly, from any war contractor.

-EXEC-
                EX. ORD. NO. 13005. EMPOWERMENT CONTRACTING            
      Ex. Ord. No. 13005, May 21, 1996, 61 F.R. 26069, provided:
      In order to promote economy and efficiency in Federal
    procurement, it is necessary to secure broad-based competition for
    Federal contracts. This broad competition is best achieved where
    there is an expansive pool of potential contractors capable of
    producing quality goods and services at competitive prices. A great
    and largely untapped opportunity for expanding the pool of such
    contractors can be found in this Nation's economically distressed
    communities.
      Fostering growth of Federal contractors in economically
    distressed communities and ensuring that those contractors become
    viable businesses for the long term will promote economy and
    efficiency in Federal procurement and help to empower those
    communities. Fostering growth of long-term viable contractors will
    be promoted by offering appropriate incentives to qualified
    businesses.
      Accordingly, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section
    486(a) [now 121(a)] of title 40, United States Code, and section
    301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as
    follows:
      Section 1. Policy. The purpose of this order is to strengthen the
    economy and to improve the efficiency of the Federal procurement
    system by encouraging business development that expands the
    industrial base and increases competition.
      Sec. 2. Empowerment Contracting Program. In consultation with the
    Secretaries of the Departments of Housing and Urban Development,
    Labor, and Defense; the Administrator of General Services; the
    Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;
    the Administrator of the Small Business Administration; and the
    Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Secretary of the
    Department of Commerce shall develop policies and procedures to
    ensure that agencies, to the extent permitted by law, grant
    qualified large businesses and qualified small businesses
    appropriate incentives to encourage business activity in areas of
    general economic distress, including a price or an evaluation
    credit, when assessing offers for government contracts in
    unrestricted competitions, where the incentives would promote the
    policy set forth in this order. In developing such policies and
    procedures, the Secretary shall consider the size of the qualified
    businesses.
      Sec. 3. Monitoring and Evaluation. The Secretary shall:
      (a) monitor the implementation and operation of the policies and
    procedures developed in accordance with this order;
      (b) develop a process to ensure the proper administration of the
    program and to reduce the potential for fraud by the intended
    beneficiaries of the program;
      (c) develop principles and a process to evaluate the
    effectiveness of the policies and procedures developed in
    accordance with this order; and
      (d) by December 1 of each year, issue a report to the President
    on the status and effectiveness of the program.
      Sec. 4. Implementation Guidelines. In implementing this order,
    the Secretary shall:
      (a) issue rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to
    implement this order, including a requirement for the periodic
    review of the eligibility of qualified businesses and distressed
    areas;
      (b) draft all rules, regulations, and guidelines necessary to
    implement this order within 90 days of the date of this order; and
      (c) ensure that all policies and procedures and all rules,
    regulations, and guidelines adopted and implemented in accordance
    with this order minimize the administrative burden on affected
    agencies and the procurement process.
      Sec. 5. Definitions. For purposes of this Executive order:
      (a) "Agency" means any authority of the United States that is an
    "agency" under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), other than those considered to be
    independent regulatory agencies, as defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(10).
      (b) "Area of general economic distress" shall be defined, for all
    urban and rural communities, as any census tract that has a poverty
    rate of at least 20 percent or any designated Federal Empowerment
    Zone, Supplemental Empowerment Zone, Enhanced Enterprise Community,
    or Enterprise Community. In addition, the Secretary may designate
    as an area of general economic distress any additional rural or
    Indian reservation area after considering the following factors:
      (1) Unemployment rate;
      (2) Degree of poverty;
      (3) Extent of outmigration; and
      (4) Rate of business formation and rate of business growth.
      (c) "Qualified large business" means a large for-profit or not-
    for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number
    of residents from the area of general economic distress; and (2)

    economic distress or has a direct impact on generating significant
    economic activity in the area of general economic distress.
      (d) "Qualified small business" means a small for-profit or not-
    for-profit trade or business that (1) employs a significant number
    of residents from the area of general economic distress; (2) has a

    distress; or (3) has a direct impact on generating significant
    economic activity in the area of general economic distress.
      (e) "Secretary" means the Secretary of Commerce.
      Sec. 6. Agency Authority. Nothing in this Executive order shall
    be construed as displacing the agencies' authority or
    responsibilities, as authorized by law, including specifically
    other programs designed to promote the development of small or
    disadvantaged businesses.
      Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This Executive order does not create any
    right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or
    equity by a party against the United States, its agencies or
    instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

                         EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 13202                     
      Ex. Ord. No. 13202, Feb. 17, 2001, 66 F.R. 11225, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13208, Apr. 6, 2001, 66 F.R. 18717, which promoted
    preservation of open competition and Government neutrality towards
    Government contractors' labor relations on Federal and Federally
    funded construction projects, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13502,
    Sec. 8, Feb. 6, 2009, 74 F.R. 6986, set out below.

      EX. ORD. NO. 13502. USE OF PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS FOR FEDERAL
                           CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS
      Ex. Ord. No. 13502, Feb. 6, 2009, 74 F.R. 6985, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.,
    and in order to promote the efficient administration and completion
    of Federal construction projects, it is hereby ordered that:
      Section 1. Policy. (a) Large-scale construction projects pose
    special challenges to efficient and timely procurement by the
    Federal Government. Construction employers typically do not have a
    permanent workforce, which makes it difficult for them to predict
    labor costs when bidding on contracts and to ensure a steady supply
    of labor on contracts being performed. Challenges also arise due to
    the fact that construction projects typically involve multiple
    employers at a single location. A labor dispute involving one
    employer can delay the entire project. A lack of coordination among
    various employers, or uncertainty about the terms and conditions of
    employment of various groups of workers, can create frictions and
    disputes in the absence of an agreed-upon resolution mechanism.
    These problems threaten the efficient and timely completion of
    construction projects undertaken by Federal contractors. On larger
    projects, which are generally more complex and of longer duration,
    these problems tend to be more pronounced.
      (b) The use of a project labor agreement may prevent these
    problems from developing by providing structure and stability to
    large-scale construction projects, thereby promoting the efficient
    and expeditious completion of Federal construction contracts.
    Accordingly, it is the policy of the Federal Government to
    encourage executive agencies to consider requiring the use of
    project labor agreements in connection with large-scale
    construction projects in order to promote economy and efficiency in
    Federal procurement.
      Sec. 2. Definitions.
      (a) The term "labor organization" as used in this order means a
    labor organization as defined in 29 U.S.C. 152(5).
      (b) The term "construction" as used in this order means
    construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension,
    repair, or improvement of buildings, highways, or other real
    property.
      (c) The term "large-scale construction project" as used in this
    order means a construction project where the total cost to the
    Federal Government is $25 million or more.
      (d) The term "executive agency" as used in this order has the
    same meaning as in 5 U.S.C. 105, but excludes the Government
    Accountability Office.
      (e) The term "project labor agreement" as used in this order
    means a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more
    labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of
    employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement
    described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).
      Sec. 3. (a) In awarding any contract in connection with a large-
    scale construction project, or obligating funds pursuant to such a
    contract, executive agencies may, on a project-by-project basis,
    require the use of a project labor agreement by a contractor where
    use of such an agreement will (i) advance the Federal Government's
    interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal
    procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring
    compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health,
    equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and
    other matters, and (ii) be consistent with law.
      (b) If an executive agency determines under subsection (a) that
    the use of a project labor agreement will satisfy the criteria in
    clauses (i) and (ii) of that subsection, the agency may, if
    appropriate, require that every contractor or subcontractor on the
    project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to
    a project labor agreement with one or more appropriate labor
    organizations.
      Sec. 4. Any project labor agreement reached pursuant to this
    order shall:
      (a) bind all contractors and subcontractors on the Construction
    project through the inclusion of appropriate specifications in all
    relevant solicitation provisions and contract documents;
      (b) allow all contractors and subcontractors to compete for
    contracts and subcontracts without regard to whether they are
    otherwise parties to collective bargaining agreements;

                          GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING                      
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Mar. 4, 2009, 74
    F.R. 9755, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
      The Federal Government has an overriding obligation to American
    taxpayers. It should perform its functions efficiently and
    effectively while ensuring that its actions result in the best
    value for the taxpayers.
      Since 2001, spending on Government contracts has more than
    doubled, reaching over $500 billion in 2008. During this same
    period, there has been a significant increase in the dollars
    awarded without full and open competition and an increase in the
    dollars obligated through cost-reimbursement contracts. Between
    fiscal years 2000 and 2008, for example, dollars obligated under
    cost-reimbursement contracts nearly doubled, from $71 billion in
    2000 to $135 billion in 2008. Reversing these trends away from full
    and open competition and toward cost-reimbursement contracts could
    result in savings of billions of dollars each year for the American
    taxpayer.
      Excessive reliance by executive agencies on sole-source contracts
    (or contracts with a limited number of sources) and cost-
    reimbursement contracts creates a risk that taxpayer funds will be
    spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject to
    misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the needs of the
    Federal Government or the interests of the American taxpayer.
    Reports by agency Inspectors General, the Government Accountability
    Office (GAO), and other independent reviewing bodies have shown
    that noncompetitive and cost-reimbursement contracts have been
    misused, resulting in wasted taxpayer resources, poor contractor
    performance, and inadequate accountability for results.
      When awarding Government contracts, the Federal Government must
    strive for an open and competitive process. However, executive
    agencies must have the flexibility to tailor contracts to carry out
    their missions and achieve the policy goals of the Government. In
    certain exigent circumstances, agencies may need to consider
    whether a competitive process will not accomplish the agency's
    mission. In such cases, the agency must ensure that the risks
    associated with noncompetitive contracts are minimized.
      Moreover, it is essential that the Federal Government have the
    capacity to carry out robust and thorough management and oversight
    of its contracts in order to achieve programmatic goals, avoid
    significant overcharges, and curb wasteful spending. A GAO study
    last year of 95 major defense acquisitions projects found cost
    overruns of 26 percent, totaling $295 billion over the life of the
    projects. Improved contract oversight could reduce such sums
    significantly.
      Government outsourcing for services also raises special concerns.
    For decades, the Federal Government has relied on the private
    sector for necessary commercial services used by the Government,
    such as transportation, food, and maintenance. Office of Management
    and Budget Circular A-76, first issued in 1966, was based on the
    reasonable premise that while inherently governmental activities
    should be performed by Government employees, taxpayers may receive
    more value for their dollars if non-inherently governmental
    activities that can be provided commercially are subject to the
    forces of competition.
      However, the line between inherently governmental activities that
    should not be outsourced and commercial activities that may be
    subject to private sector competition has been blurred and
    inadequately defined. As a result, contractors may be performing
    inherently governmental functions. Agencies and departments must
    operate under clear rules prescribing when outsourcing is and is
    not appropriate.
      It is the policy of the Federal Government that executive
    agencies shall not engage in noncompetitive contracts except in
    those circumstances where their use can be fully justified and
    where appropriate safeguards have been put in place to protect the
    taxpayer. In addition, there shall be a preference for fixed-price
    type contracts. Cost-reimbursement contracts shall be used only
    when circumstances do not allow the agency to define its
    requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract.
    Moreover, the Federal Government shall ensure that taxpayer dollars
    are not spent on contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, subject
    to misuse, or otherwise not well designed to serve the Federal
    Government's needs and to manage the risk associated with the goods
    and services being procured. The Federal Government must have
    sufficient capacity to manage and oversee the contracting process
    from start to finish, so as to ensure that taxpayer funds are spent
    wisely and are not subject to excessive risk. Finally, the Federal
    Government must ensure that those functions that are inherently
    governmental in nature are performed by executive agencies and are
    not outsourced.
      I hereby direct the Director of the Office of Management and
    Budget (OMB), in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the
    Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
    the Administrator of General Services, the Director of the Office
    of Personnel Management, and the heads of such other agencies as
    the Director of OMB determines to be appropriate, and with the
    participation of appropriate management councils and program
    management officials, to develop and issue by July 1, 2009,
    Government-wide guidance to assist agencies in reviewing, and
    creating processes for ongoing review of, existing contracts in
    order to identify contracts that are wasteful, inefficient, or not
    otherwise likely to meet the agency's needs, and to formulate
    appropriate corrective action in a timely manner. Such corrective
    action may include modifying or canceling such contracts in a
    manner and to the extent consistent with applicable laws,
    regulations, and policy.
      I further direct the Director of OMB, in collaboration with the
    aforementioned officials and councils, and with input from the
    public, to develop and issue by September 30, 2009, Government-wide
    guidance to:
      (1) govern the appropriate use and oversight of sole-source and
    other types of noncompetitive contracts and to maximize the use of
    full and open competition and other competitive procurement
    processes;
      (2) govern the appropriate use and oversight of all contract
    types, in full consideration of the agency's needs, and to minimize
    risk and maximize the value of Government contracts generally,
    consistent with the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to
    section 864 of Public Law 110-417;
      (3) assist agencies in assessing the capacity and ability of the
    Federal acquisition workforce to develop, manage, and oversee
    acquisitions appropriately; and
      (4) clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is
    not appropriate, consistent with section 321 of Public Law 110-417
    (31 U.S.C. 501 note).
      Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions
    of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law. This memorandum
    is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit,
    substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any
    party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or
    entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
      The Director of OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish
    this memorandum in the Federal Register.

        "(2) the conditions which have caused or are causing such cost
      increases were, or are being, experienced generally by other
      small business concerns in the market at the same time and are
      not caused by negligence, underbidding, or other special
      management factors peculiar to that small business concern.
      "(b) Upon application under subsection (a) by a small business
    concern to terminate a fixed-price contract between an executive
    agency and such small business concern, the head of the executive
    agency may modify the terms of the contract in lieu of termination
    for the convenience of the Government only if he finds after review
    of the application that - 
        "(1)(a) the agency would reprocure the supplies or services in
      the event that the contract was terminated for the convenience of
      the Government; and
        "(b) the cost of terminating the contract for the convenience
      of the Government plus the cost of reprocurement would exceed the
      amount of the contract as modified; and
        "(2) Any such modification shall be made in compliance with
      cost comparison and compensation guidelines to be issued by the
      Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. Such
      cost comparison and compensation guidelines shall be promulgated
      by the Administrator not later than 10 days after enactment of
      this Act [Dec. 31, 1975].
      "(c) If a small business concern in performance of a fixed-price
    Government contract experiences or has experienced shortages of
    energy, petroleum products, or products or components manufactured
    or derived therefrom or impacted thereby, and such shortages result
    in a delay in the performance of a contract, the head of the
    agency, or his designee, shall provide by modification to the
    contract for an appropriate extension of the contract delivery date
    or period of performance.
      "(d) A small business concern requesting relief under subsection
    (a) shall support that request with the following documentation and
    certification:
        "(1) a brief description of the contract, indicating the date
      of execution and of any amendment thereto, the items being
      procured, the price and delivery schedule, and any revision
      thereof, and any other special contractual provision as may be
      relevant to the request;
        "(2) a history of performance indicating when work under the
      contract or commitment was begun, the progress made as of the
      date of the application, an exact statement of the contractor's
      remaining obligations, and the contractor's expectations
      regarding completion thereof;
        "(3) a statement of the factors which have caused the loss
      under the contract;
        "(4) a statement as to the course of events anticipated if the
      request is denied;
        "(5) a statement of payments received, payments due and
      payments yet to be received or to become due, including advance
      and progress payments, and amounts withheld by the Government,
      and information as to other obligations of the Government, if
      any, which are yet to be performed under the contract;
        "(6) a statement and evidence of the contractor's original
      breakdown of estimated costs, including contingency allowances
      and profit;
        "(7) a statement and evidence of the contractor's present
      estimate of total costs under the contract if enabled to
      complete, broken down between costs accrued to date of request,
      and runout costs, and as between costs for which the contractor
      has made payment and those for which he is indebted at the time
      of the request;
        "(8) a statement and evidence of the contractor's estimate of
      the final price of the contract, giving effect to all escalation,
      changes, extras, and other comparable factors known or
      contemplated by the contractor;
        "(9) a statement of any claims known or contemplated by the
      contractor against the Government involving the contract in
      question, other than those referred to under (8) above;
        "(10) an estimate of the contractor's total profit or loss
      under the contract if required to complete at the original
      contract price;
        "(11) an estimate of the total profits from other Government
      business, and all other sources, during the period from the date
      of the first contract involved to the latest estimated date of
      completion of any other contracts involved;
        "(12) balance sheets, certified by a certified public
      accountant, as of the end of the contractor's fiscal year first
      preceding the date of the first contract, as of the end of each
      subsequent fiscal year, and as of the date of the request
      together with income statements for annual periods subsequent to
      the date of the first balance sheet; and
        "(13) a list of all salaries, bonuses, and all other forms of
      compensation of the principal officers or partners and of all
      dividends and other withdrawals, and all payments to stockholders
      in any form since the date of the first contract involved.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253. Competition requirements

-STATUTE-
    (a) Procurement through full and open competition; competitive
      procedures
      (1) Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (g) of this
    section and except in the case of procurement procedures otherwise
    expressly authorized by statute, an executive agency in conducting
    a procurement for property or services - 
        (A) shall obtain full and open competition through the use of
      competitive procedures in accordance with the requirements of
      this subchapter and the Federal Acquisition Regulation; and
        (B) shall use the competitive procedure or combination of
      competitive procedures that is best suited under the
      circumstances of the procurement.

      (2) In determining the competitive procedures appropriate under
    the circumstance, an executive agency - 
        (A) shall solicit sealed bids if - 
          (i) time permits the solicitation, submission, and evaluation
        of sealed bids;
          (ii) the award will be made on the basis of price and other
        price-related factors;
          (iii) it is not necessary to conduct discussions with the
        responding sources about their bids; and
          (iv) there is a reasonable expectation of receiving more than
        one sealed bid; and

        (B) shall request competitive proposals if sealed bids are not
      appropriate under clause (A).
    (b) Exclusion of particular source; restriction of solicitation to
      small business concerns
      (1) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of
    property or services covered by this section using competitive
    procedures but excluding a particular source in order to establish
    or maintain any alternative source or sources of supply for that
    property or service if the agency head determines that to do so - 
        (A) would increase or maintain competition and would likely
      result in reduced overall costs for such procurement, or for any
      anticipated procurement, of such property or services;
        (B) would be in the interest of national defense in having a
      facility (or a producer, manufacturer, or other supplier)
      available for furnishing the property or service in case of a
      national emergency or industrial mobilization;
        (C) would be in the interest of national defense in
      establishing or maintaining an essential engineering, research,
      or development capability to be provided by an educational or
      other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and
      development center;
        (D) would ensure the continuous availability of a reliable
      source of supply of such property or service;
        (E) would satisfy projected needs for such property or service
      determined on the basis of a history of high demand for the
      property or service; or
        (F) in the case of medical supplies, safety supplies, or
      emergency supplies, would satisfy a critical need for such
      supplies.

      (2) An executive agency may provide for the procurement of
    property or services covered by this section using competitive
    procedures, but excluding other than small business concerns in
    furtherance of sections 638 and 644 of title 15.
      (3) A contract awarded pursuant to the competitive procedures
    referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be subject to the
    justification and approval required by subsection (f)(1) of this
    section.
      (4) A determination under paragraph (1) may not be made for a
    class of purchases or contracts.
    (c) Use of noncompetitive procedures
      An executive agency may use procedures other than competitive
    procedures only when - 
        (1) the property or services needed by the executive agency are
      available from only one responsible source and no other type of
      property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive
      agency;
        (2) the executive agency's need for the property or services is
      of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government
      would be seriously injured unless the executive agency is
      permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits
      bids or proposals;
        (3) it is necessary to award the contract to a particular
      source or sources in order (A) to maintain a facility, producer,
      manufacturer, or other supplier available for furnishing property
      or services in case of a national emergency or to achieve
      industrial mobilization, (B) to establish or maintain an
      essential engineering, research, or development capability to be
      provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a
      federally funded research and development center, or (C) to
      procure the services of an expert for use, in any litigation or
      dispute (including any reasonably foreseeable litigation or
      dispute) involving the Federal Government, in any trial, hearing,
      or proceeding before any court, administrative tribunal, or
      agency, or to procure the services of an expert or neutral for
      use in any part of an alternative dispute resolution or
      negotiated rulemaking process, whether or not the expert is
      expected to testify;
        (4) the terms of an international agreement or treaty between
      the United States Government and a foreign government or
      international organization, or the written directions of a
      foreign government reimbursing the executive agency for the cost
      of the procurement of the property or services for such
      government, have the effect of requiring the use of procedures
      other than competitive procedures;
        (5) subject to subsection (h) (!1) of this section, a statute
      expressly authorizes or requires that the procurement be made
      through another executive agency or from a specified source, or
      the agency's need is for a brand-name commercial item for
      authorized resale;

        (6) the disclosure of the executive agency's needs would
      compromise the national security unless the agency is permitted
      to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or
      proposals; or
        (7) the head of the executive agency - 
          (A) determines that it is necessary in the public interest to
        use procedures other than competitive procedures in the
        particular procurement concerned, and
          (B) notifies the Congress in writing of such determination
        not less than 30 days before the award of the contract.
    (d) Property or services deemed available from only one source;
      nondelegable authority
      (1) For the purposes of applying subsection (c)(1) of this
    section - 
        (A) in the case of a contract for property or services to be
      awarded on the basis of acceptance of an unsolicited research
      proposal, the property or services shall be considered to be
      available from only one source if the source has submitted an
      unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and
      innovative concept the substance of which is not otherwise
      available to the United States and does not resemble the
      substance of a pending competitive procurement; and
        (B) in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued
      development or production of a major system or highly specialized
      equipment when it is likely that award to a source other than the
      original source would result in (i) substantial duplication of
      cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered
      through competition, or (ii) unacceptable delays in fulfilling
      the executive agency's needs, such property may be deemed to be
      available only from the original source and may be procured
      through procedures other than competitive procedures.

      (2) The authority of the head of an executive agency under
    subsection (c)(7) of this section may not be delegated.
      (3)(A) The contract period of a contract described in
    subparagraph (B) that is entered into by an executive agency
    pursuant to the authority provided under subsection (c)(2) - 
        (i) may not exceed the time necessary - 
          (I) to meet the unusual and compelling requirements of the
        work to be performed under the contract; and
          (II) for the executive agency to enter into another contract
        for the required goods or services through the use of
        competitive procedures; and

        (ii) may not exceed one year unless the head of the executive
      agency entering into such contract determines that exceptional
      circumstances apply.

      (B) This paragraph applies to any contract in an amount greater
    than the simplified acquisition threshold.
    (e) Offer requests to potential sources
      An executive agency using procedures other than competitive
    procedures to procure property or services by reason of the
    application of subsection (c)(2) or (c)(6) of this section shall
    request offers from as many potential sources as is practicable
    under the circumstances.
    (f) Justification for use of noncompetitive procedures
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an executive agency may
    not award a contract using procedures other than competitive
    procedures unless - 
        (A) the contracting officer for the contract justifies the use
      of such procedures in writing and certifies the accuracy and
      completeness of the justification;
        (B) the justification is approved - 
          (i) in the case of a contract for an amount exceeding
        $500,000 (but equal to or less than $10,000,000), by the

      (2) In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(2),
    the justification and approval required by paragraph (1) may be
    made after the contract is awarded. The justification and approval
    required by paragraph (1) is not required -

      for authorized resale;
        (C) in the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(7)
      of this section; or

      based on the proposed contractor's qualifications or the nature
      of the procurement, of the reasons for using that exception;
        (C) a determination that the anticipated cost will be fair and
      reasonable;
        (D) a description of the market survey conducted or a statement

        (F) a statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to
      remove or overcome a barrier to competition before a subsequent
      procurement for such needs.

      (4) In no case may an executive agency - 
        (A) enter into a contract for property or services using
      procedures other than competitive procedures on the basis of the
      lack of advance planning or concerns related to the amount of
      funds available to the agency for procurement functions; or
        (B) procure property or services from another executive agency
      unless such other executive agency complies fully with the
      requirements of this subchapter in its procurement of such
      property or services.

    The restriction set out in clause (B) is in addition to, and not in
    lieu of, any other restriction provided by law.
    (g) Simplified procedures for small purchases
      (1) In order to promote efficiency and economy in contracting and
    to avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors, the
    Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for - 
        (A) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and
      services for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition
      threshold; and
        (B) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and
      services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition
      threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which
      the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature
      of the property or services sought and on market research, that
      offers will include only commercial items.

      (2)(A) The Administrator of General Services shall prescribe
    regulations that provide special simplified procedures for
    acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property at rental
    rates that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the rental rate or rates
    under a multiyear lease do not exceed the simplified acquisition
    threshold if the average annual amount of the rent payable for the
    period of the lease does not exceed the simplified acquisition
    threshold.
      (3) A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the
    simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several
    purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the
    simplified procedures required by paragraph (1).
      (4) In using the simplified procedures, an executive agency shall
    promote competition to the maximum extent practicable.
      (5) An executive agency shall comply with the Federal Acquisition
    Regulation provisions referred to in section 427(f) of this title.
    (h) Efficient implementation of requirement
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall ensure that the
    requirement to obtain full and open competition is implemented in a
    manner that is consistent with the need to efficiently fulfill the
    Government's requirements.
    (i) Merit-based award of contracts
      (1) It is the policy of Congress that an executive agency should
    not be required by legislation to award a new contract to a
    specific non-Federal Government entity. It is further the policy of
    Congress that any program, project, or technology identified in
    legislation be procured through merit-based selection procedures.
      (2) A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new
    contract to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity
    unless that provision of law - 
        (A) specifically refers to this subsection;
        (B) specifically identifies the particular non-Federal
      Government entity involved; and
        (C) specifically states that the award to that entity is
      required by such provision of law in contravention of the policy
      set forth in paragraph (1).

      (3) For purposes of this subsection, a contract is a new contract
    unless the work provided for in the contract is a continuation of
    the work performed by the specified entity under a preceding
    contract.
      (4) This subsection shall not apply with respect to any contract
    that calls upon the National Academy of Sciences to investigate,
    examine, or experiment upon any subject of science or art of
    significance to an executive agency and to report on such matters
    to the Congress or any agency of the Federal Government.
      (j)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of
    a procurement permitted by subsection (c), the head of an executive
    agency shall make publicly available, within 14 days after the
    award of the contract, the documents containing the justification
    and approval required by subsection (f)(1) with respect to the
    procurement.
      (B) In the case of a procurement permitted by subsection (c)(2),
    subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting "30 days" for "14
    days".
      (2) The documents shall be made available on the website of the
    agency and through a government-wide website selected by the
    Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy.
      (3) This subsection does not require the public availability of
    information that is exempt from public disclosure under section
    552(b) of title 5.

      (1) In preparing for the procurement of property or services, an

      designed to achieve full and open competition for the
      procurement;
        (B) use advance procurement planning and market research; and
        (C) develop specifications in such manner as is necessary to
      obtain full and open competition with due regard to the nature of
      the property or services to be acquired.

      (2) Each solicitation under this subchapter shall include
    specifications which - 
        (A) consistent with the provisions of this subchapter, permit
      full and open competition;
        (B) include restrictive provisions or conditions only to the
      extent necessary to satisfy the needs of the executive agency or
      as authorized by law.

      (3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), the type of
    specification included in a solicitation shall depend on the nature
    of the needs of the executive agency and the market available to
    satisfy such needs. Subject to such needs, specifications may be
    stated in terms of - 
        (A) function, so that a variety of products or services may
      qualify;
        (B) performance, including specifications of the range of
      acceptable characteristics or of the minimum acceptable
      standards; or
        (C) design requirements.
    (b) Contents of solicitation
      In addition to the specifications described in subsection (a) of
    this section, each solicitation for sealed bids or competitive
    proposals (other than for a procurement for commercial items using
    special simplified procedures or a purchase for an amount not
    greater than the simplified acquisition threshold) shall at a
    minimum include - 
        (1) a statement of - 
          (A) all significant factors and significant subfactors which
        the executive agency reasonably expects to consider in
        evaluating sealed bids (including price) or competitive
        proposals (including cost or price, cost-related or price-
        related factors and subfactors, and noncost-related or
        nonprice-related factors and subfactors); and
          (B) the relative importance assigned to each of those factors
        and subfactors; and

        (2)(A) in the case of sealed bids - 
          (i) a statement that sealed bids will be evaluated without
        discussions with the bidders; and
          (ii) the time and place for the opening of the sealed bids;
        or

        (B) in the case of competitive proposals - 
          (i) either a statement that the proposals are intended to be
        evaluated with, and award made after, discussions with the
        offerors, or a statement that the proposals are intended to be
        evaluated, and award made, without discussions with the
        offerors (other than discussions conducted for the purpose of
        minor clarification) unless discussions are determined to be
        necessary; and
          (ii) the time and place for submission of proposals.
    (c) Evaluation factors
      (1) In prescribing the evaluation factors to be included in each
    solicitation for competitive proposals, an executive agency - 
        (A) shall clearly establish the relative importance assigned to
      the evaluation factors and subfactors, including the quality of
      the product or services to be provided (including technical
      capability, management capability, prior experience, and past
      performance of the offeror);
        (B) shall include cost or price to the Federal Government as an
      evaluation factor that must be considered in the evaluation of
      proposals; and
        (C) shall disclose to offerors whether all evaluation factors
      other than cost or price, when combined, are - 
          (i) significantly more important than cost or price;
          (ii) approximately equal in importance to cost or price; or
          (iii) significantly less important than cost or price.

      (2) The regulations implementing subparagraph (C) of paragraph
    (1) may not define the terms "significantly more important" and
    "significantly less important" as specific numeric weights that
    would be applied uniformly to all solicitations or a class of
    solicitations.
    (d) Additional information in solicitation
      Nothing in this section prohibits an executive agency from - 
        (1) providing additional information in a solicitation,
      including numeric weights for all evaluation factors and
      subfactors on a case-by-case basis; or
        (2) stating in a solicitation that award will be made to the
      offeror that meets the solicitation's mandatory requirements at
      the lowest cost or price.
    (e) Evaluation of purchase options
      An executive agency, in issuing a solicitation for a contract to
    be awarded using sealed bid procedures, may not include in such
    solicitation a clause providing for the evaluation of prices for
    options to purchase additional property or services under the
    contract unless the executive agency has determined that there is a
    reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised.

    than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 24,
    2003], the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall amend the
    Federal Acquisition Regulation issued in accordance with sections 6

      offeror's employees to telecommute, unless the contracting
      officer concerned first determines that the requirements of the

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253b. Evaluation and award

-STATUTE-
    (a) Basis
      An executive agency shall evaluate sealed bids and competitive
    proposals, and award a contract, based solely on the factors
    specified in the solicitation.
    (b) Rejection of bids or proposals
      All sealed bids or competitive proposals received in response to
    a solicitation may be rejected if the agency head determines that
    such action is in the public interest.
    (c) Opening of bids; promptness of award; written notice
      Sealed bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated
    in the solicitation. The executive agency shall evaluate the bids
    in accordance with subsection (a) of this section without
    discussions with the bidders and, except as provided in subsection
    (b) of this section, shall award a contract with reasonable
    promptness to the responsible source whose bid conforms to the
    solicitation and is most advantageous to the United States,
    considering only price and the other price-related factors included
    in the solicitation. The award of a contract shall be made by
    transmitting, in writing or by electronic means, notice of the
    award to the successful bidder. Within 3 days after the date of
    contract award, the executive agency shall notify, in writing or by
    electronic means, each bidder not awarded the contract that the
    contract has been awarded.
    (d) Discussions with offerors; written notification
      (1) An executive agency shall evaluate competitive proposals in
    accordance with subsection (a) of this section and may award a
    contract - 
        (A) after discussions with the offerors, provided that written
      or oral discussions have been conducted with all responsible
      offerors who submit proposals within the competitive range; or
        (B) based on the proposals received and without discussions
      with the offerors (other than discussions conducted for the
      purpose of minor clarification), if, as required by section
      253a(b)(2)(B)(i) of this title, the solicitation included a
      statement that proposals are intended to be evaluated, and award
      made, without discussions, unless discussions are determined to
      be necessary.

      (2) If the contracting officer determines that the number of
    offerors that would otherwise be included in the competitive range
    under paragraph (1)(A) exceeds the number at which an efficient
    competition can be conducted, the contracting officer may limit the
    number of proposals in the competitive range, in accordance with
    the criteria specified in the solicitation, to the greatest number
    that will permit an efficient competition among the offerors rated
    most highly in accordance with such criteria.
      (3) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this
    section, the executive agency shall award a contract with
    reasonable promptness to the responsible source whose proposal is
    most advantageous to the United States, considering only cost or
    price and the other factors included in the solicitation. The
    executive agency shall award the contract by transmitting, in
    writing or by electronic means, notice of the award to such source
    and, within 3 days after the date of contract award, shall notify,
    in writing or by electronic means, all other offerors of the
    rejection of their proposals.
    (e) Post-award debriefings
      (1) When a contract is awarded by the head of an executive agency
    on the basis of competitive proposals, an unsuccessful offeror,
    upon written request received by the agency within 3 days after the
    date on which the unsuccessful offeror receives the notification of
    the contract award, shall be debriefed and furnished the basis for
    the selection decision and contract award. The executive agency
    shall debrief the offeror within, to the maximum extent
    practicable, 5 days after receipt of the request by the executive
    agency.
      (2) The debriefing shall include, at a minimum - 
        (A) the executive agency's evaluation of the significant weak
      or deficient factors in the offeror's offer;
        (B) the overall evaluated cost and technical rating of the
      offer of the contractor awarded the contract and the overall
      evaluated cost and technical rating of the offer of the debriefed
      offeror;
        (C) the overall ranking of all offers;
        (D) a summary of the rationale for the award;
        (E) in the case of a proposal that includes a commercial item
      that is an end item under the contract, the make and model of the
      item being provided in accordance with the offer of the
      contractor awarded the contract; and
        (F) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the
      debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set
      forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other
      applicable authorities were followed by the executive agency.

      (3) The debriefing may not include point-by-point comparisons of
    the debriefed offeror's offer with other offers and may not
    disclose any information that is exempt from disclosure under
    section 552(b) of title 5.
      (4) Each solicitation for competitive proposals shall include a
    statement that information described in paragraph (2) may be
    disclosed in post-award debriefings.
      (5) If, within one year after the date of the contract award and
    as a result of a successful procurement protest, the executive
    agency seeks to fulfill the requirement under the protested
    contract either on the basis of a new solicitation of offers or on
    the basis of new best and final offers requested for that contract,
    the head of such executive agency shall make available to all
    offerors - 
        (A) the information provided in debriefings under this
      subsection regarding the offer of the contractor awarded the
      contract; and
        (B) the same information that would have been provided to the
      original offerors.
    (f) Preaward debriefings
      (1) When the contracting officer excludes an offeror submitting a
    competitive proposal from the competitive range (or otherwise
    excludes such an offeror from further consideration prior to the
    final source selection decision), the excluded offeror may request
    in writing, within 3 days after the date on which the excluded
    offeror receives notice of its exclusion, a debriefing prior to
    award. The contracting officer shall make every effort to debrief
    the unsuccessful offeror as soon as practicable but may refuse the
    request for a debriefing if it is not in the best interests of the
    Government to conduct a debriefing at that time.
      (2) The contracting officer is required to debrief an excluded
    offeror in accordance with subsection (e) of this section only if
    that offeror requested and was refused a preaward debriefing under
    paragraph (1) of this subsection.
      (3) The debriefing conducted under this subsection shall include -
     
        (A) the executive agency's evaluation of the significant
      elements in the offeror's offer;
        (B) a summary of the rationale for the offeror's exclusion; and
        (C) reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the
      debriefed offeror as to whether source selection procedures set
      forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other
      applicable authorities were followed by the executive agency.

      (4) The debriefing conducted pursuant to this subsection may not
    disclose the number or identity of other offerors and shall not
    disclose information about the content, ranking, or evaluation of
    other offerors' proposals.
    (g) Summary of debriefing
      The contracting officer shall include a summary of any debriefing
    conducted under subsection (e) or (f) of this section in the
    contract file.
    (h) Alternative dispute resolution
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include a provision
    encouraging the use of alternative dispute resolution techniques to
    provide informal, expeditious, and inexpensive procedures for an
    offeror to consider using before filing a protest, prior to the
    award of a contract, of the exclusion of the offeror from the
    competitive range (or otherwise from further consideration) for
    that contract.
    (i) Antitrust violations
      If the agency head considers that a bid or proposal evidences a
    violation of the antitrust laws, such agency head shall refer the
    bid or proposal to the Attorney General for appropriate action.
    (j) Planning for future competition
      (1)(A) In preparing a solicitation for the award of a development
    contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider
    requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer
    proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to
    require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due
    consideration to the purposes for which the system is being
    procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required
    capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the
    agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.
      (B) The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider
    requiring in a solicitation for the award of a development contract
    are the following:
        (i) Proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system
      items which are currently available within the supply system of
      the Federal agency responsible for the major system, available
      elsewhere in the national supply system, or commercially
      available from more than one source.
        (ii) With respect to items that are likely to be required in
      substantial quantities during the system's service life,
      proposals to incorporate in the design of the major system items
      which the United States will be able to acquire competitively in
      the future.

      (2)(A) In preparing a solicitation for the award of a production
    contract for a major system, the head of an agency shall consider
    requiring in the solicitation that an offeror include in its offer
    proposals described in subparagraph (B). In determining whether to
    require such proposals, the head of the agency shall give due
    consideration to the purposes for which the system is being
    procured and the technology necessary to meet the system's required
    capabilities. If such proposals are required, the head of the
    agency shall consider them in evaluating the offeror's price.
      (B) The proposals that the head of an agency is to consider
    requiring in a solicitation for the award of a production contract
    are proposals identifying opportunities to ensure that the United
    States will be able to obtain on a competitive basis items procured
    in connection with the system that are likely to be reprocured in
    substantial quantities during the service life of the system.
    Proposals submitted in response to such requirement may include the
    following:
        (i) Proposals to provide to the United States the right to use
      technical data to be provided under the contract for competitive
      reprocurement of the item, together with the cost to the United
      States, if any, of acquiring such technical data and the right to
      use such data.
        (ii) Proposals for the qualification or development of multiple
      sources of supply for the item.

      (3) If the head of an agency is making a noncompetitive award of
    a development contract or a production contract for a major system,
    the factors specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) to be considered in
    evaluating an offer for a contract may be considered as objectives
    in negotiating the contract to be awarded.
    (k) Protest file
      (1) If, in the case of a solicitation for a contract issued by,
    or an award or proposed award of a contract by, the head of an
    executive agency, a protest is filed pursuant to the procedures in
    subchapter V of chapter 35 of title 31, and an actual or
    prospective offeror so requests, a file of the protest shall be
    established by the procuring activity and reasonable access shall
    be provided to actual or prospective offerors.
      (2) Information exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title
    5 may be redacted in a file established pursuant to paragraph (1)
    unless an applicable protective order provides otherwise.
    (l) Agency actions on protests
      If, in connection with a protest, the head of an executive agency
    determines that a solicitation, proposed award, or award does not
    comply with the requirements of law or regulation, the head of such
    executive agency - 
        (1) may take any action set out in subparagraphs (A) through
      (F) of subsection (b)(1) of section 3554 of title 31; and
        (2) may pay costs described in paragraph (1) of section 3554(c)
      of such title within the limits referred to in paragraph (2) of
      such section.
    (m) Prohibition on release of contractor proposals
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a proposal in the
    possession or control of an executive agency may not be made
    available to any person under section 552 of title 5.
      (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to any proposal that is set
    forth or incorporated by reference in a contract entered into
    between the agency and the contractor that submitted the proposal.
      (3) In this subsection, the term "proposal" means any proposal,
    including a technical, management, or cost proposal, submitted by a
    contractor in response to the requirements of a solicitation for a
    competitive proposal.

-EXEC-
              EX. ORD. NO. 12979. AGENCY PROCUREMENT PROTESTS          
      Ex. Ord. No. 12979, Oct. 25, 1995, 60 F.R. 55171, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to
    ensure effective and efficient expenditure of public funds and fair
    and expeditious resolution of protests to the award of Federal
    procurement contracts, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Heads of executive departments and agencies
    ("agencies") engaged in the procurement of supplies and services
    shall prescribe administrative procedures for the resolution of
    protests to the award of their procurement contracts as an
    alternative to protests in fora outside the procuring agencies.
    Procedures prescribed pursuant to this order shall:
      (a) emphasize that whenever conduct of a procurement is
    contested, all parties should use their best efforts to resolve the
    matter with agency contracting officers;
      (b) to the maximum extent practicable, provide for inexpensive,
    informal, procedurally simple, and expeditious resolution of
    protests, including, where appropriate and as permitted by law, the
    use of alternative dispute resolution techniques, third party
    neutrals, and another agency's personnel;
      (c) allow actual or prospective bidders or offerors whose direct
    economic interests would be affected by the award or failure to
    award the contract to request a review, at a level above the
    contracting officer, of any decision by a contracting officer that
    is alleged to have violated a statute or regulation and, thereby,
    caused prejudice to the protester; and
      (d) except where immediate contract award or performance is
    justified for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined to be
    in the best interest of the United States, prohibit award or
    performance of the contract while a timely filed protest is pending
    before the agency. To allow for the withholding of a contract award
    or performance, the agency must have received notice of the protest
    within either 10 calendar days after the contract award or 5
    calendar days after the bidder or offeror who is protesting the
    contract award was given the opportunity to be debriefed by the
    agency, whichever date is later.
      Sec. 2. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall:
    (a) work with the heads of executive agencies to provide policy
    guidance and leadership necessary to implement provisions of this
    order; and
      (b) review and evaluate agency experience and performance under
    this order, and report on any findings to the President within 2
    years from the date of this order.
      Sec. 3. The Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of
    Defense, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration, in coordination with the Office of Federal
    Procurement Policy, shall amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation,
    48 C.F.R. 1, within 180 days of the date of this order to further
    the purposes of this order.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253c. Encouragement of new competition

-STATUTE-
    (a) "Qualification requirement" defined
      In this section, "qualification requirement" means a requirement
    for testing or other quality assurance demonstration that must be
    completed by an offeror before award of a contract.
    (b) Agency head; functions; prior to enforcement of qualification
      requirement
      Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the head of
    the agency shall, before enforcing any qualification requirement - 
        (1) prepare a written justification stating the necessity for
      establishing the qualification requirement and specify why the
      qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract
      award;
        (2) specify in writing and make available to a potential
      offeror upon request all requirements which a prospective
      offeror, or its product, must satisfy in order to become
      qualified, such requirements to be limited to those least
      restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment
      of the qualification requirement;
        (3) specify an estimate of the costs of testing and evaluation
      likely to be incurred by a potential offeror in order to become
      qualified;
        (4) ensure that a potential offeror is provided, upon request,
      a prompt opportunity to demonstrate at its own expense (except as
      provided in subsection (d) of this section) its ability to meet
      the standards specified for qualification using qualified
      personnel and facilities of the agency concerned or of another
      agency obtained through interagency agreement, or under contract,
      or other methods approved by the agency (including use of
      approved testing and evaluation services not provided under
      contract to the agency);
        (5) if testing and evaluation services are provided under
      contract to the agency for the purposes of clause (4), provide to
      the extent possible that such services be provided by a
      contractor who is not expected to benefit from an absence of
      additional qualified sources and who shall be required in such
      contract to adhere to any restriction on technical data asserted
      by the potential offeror seeking qualification; and
        (6) ensure that a potential offeror seeking qualification is
      promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in
      the event qualification is not attained, is promptly furnished
      specific information why qualification was not attained.
    (c) Applicability; waiver authority; referral of offers
      (1) Subsection (b) of this section does not apply with respect to
    a qualification requirement established by statute prior to October
    30, 1984.
      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if it is unreasonable to
    specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror
    or its product must satisfy, a determination to that effect shall
    be submitted to the advocate for competition of the procuring
    activity responsible for the purchase of the item subject to the
    qualification requirement. After considering any comments of the
    advocate for competition reviewing such determination, the head of
    the procuring activity may waive the requirements of paragraphs (2)
    through (5) of subsection (b) of this section for up to two years
    with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement.
      (3) The waiver authority contained in paragraph (2) shall not
    apply with respect to any qualified products list.
      (4) A potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to
    submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because
    the potential offeror has not been identified as meeting a
    qualification requirement, if the potential offeror can demonstrate
    to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential
    offeror or its product meets the standards established for
    qualification or can meet such standards before the date specified
    for award of the contract.
      (5) Nothing contained in this subsection requires the referral of
    an offer to the Small Business Administration pursuant to section
    637(b)(7) of title 15 if the basis for the referral is a challenge
    by the offeror to either the validity of the qualification
    requirement or the offeror's compliance with such requirement.
      (6) The head of an agency need not delay a proposed procurement
    in order to comply with subsection (b) of this section or in order
    to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate
    its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.
    (d) Number; qualified sources or products; fewer than two actual
      manufacturers; functions of agency head
      (1) If the number of qualified sources or qualified products
    available to compete actively for an anticipated future requirement
    is fewer than two actual manufacturers or the products of two
    actual manufacturers, respectively, the head of the agency
    concerned shall - 
        (A) periodically publish notice in the Commerce Business Daily
      soliciting additional sources or products to seek qualification,
      unless the contracting officer determines that such publication
      would compromise national security; and
        (B) bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and
      evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the
      item or establishing the production, quality control, or other
      system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern
      or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has
      met the standards specified for qualification and which could
      reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that
      requirement, but such costs may be borne only if the head of the
      agency determines that such additional qualified sources or
      products are likely to result in cost savings from increased
      competition for future requirements sufficient to offset (within
      a reasonable period of time considering the duration and dollar
      value of anticipated future requirements) the costs incurred by
      the agency.

      (2) The head of an agency shall require a prospective contractor
    requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs
    under paragraph (1)(B) to certify as to its status as a small
    business concern under section 632 of title 15.
    (e) Examination; need for qualification requirement
      Within seven years after the establishment of a qualification
    requirement, the need for such qualification requirement shall be
    examined and the standards of such requirement revalidated in
    accordance with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.
    The preceding sentence does not apply in the case of a
    qualification requirement for which a waiver is in effect under
    subsection (c)(2) of this section.
    (f) Enforcement determination by agency head
      Except in an emergency as determined by the head of the agency,
    whenever the head of the agency determines not to enforce a
    qualification requirement for a solicitation, the agency may not
    thereafter enforce that qualification requirement unless the agency
    complies with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253d. Validation of proprietary data restrictions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Contracts; delivery of technical services; contents
      A contract for property or services entered into by an executive
    agency which provides for the delivery of technical data, shall
    provide that - 
        (1) a contractor or subcontractor at any tier shall be prepared
      to furnish to the contracting officer a written justification for
      any restriction asserted by the contractor or subcontractor on
      the right of the United States to use such technical data; and
        (2) the contracting officer may review the validity of any
      restriction asserted by the contractor or by a subcontractor
      under the contract on the right of the United States to use
      technical data furnished to the United States under the contract
      if the contracting officer determines that reasonable grounds
      exist to question the current validity of the asserted
      restriction and that the continued adherence to the asserted
      restriction by the United States would make it impracticable to
      procure the item competitively at a later time.
    (b) Review; challenge; notice
      If after such review the contracting officer determines that a
    challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the contracting
    officer shall provide written notice to the contractor or
    subcontractor asserting the restriction. Such notice shall state - 
        (1) the grounds for challenging the asserted restriction; and
        (2) the requirement for a response within 60 days justifying
      the current validity of the asserted restriction.
    (c) Written request; additional time; schedule of responses
      If a contractor or subcontractor asserting a restriction subject
    to this section submits to the contracting officer a written
    request, showing the need for additional time to comply with the
    requirement to justify the current validity of the asserted
    restriction, additional time to adequately permit the submission of
    such justification shall be provided by the contracting officer as
    appropriate. If a party asserting a restriction receives notices of
    challenges to restrictions on technical data from more than one
    contracting officer, and notifies each contracting officer of the
    existence of more than one challenge, the contracting officer
    initiating the first in time challenge, after consultation with the
    party asserting the restriction and the other contracting officers,
    shall formulate a schedule of responses to each of the challenges
    that will afford the party asserting the restriction with an
    equitable opportunity to respond to each such challenge.
    (d) Decision; validity of asserted restriction; failure to submit
      response
      (1) Upon a failure by the contractor or subcontractor to submit
    any response under subsection (b) of this section, the contracting
    officer shall issue a decision pertaining to the validity of the
    asserted restriction.
      (2) If a justification is submitted in response to the notice
    provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a contracting
    officer shall within 60 days of receipt of any justification
    submitted, issue a decision or notify the party asserting the
    restriction of the time within which a decision will be issued.
    (e) Claim; considered claim within Contract Disputes Act of 1978
      If a claim pertaining to the validity of the asserted restriction
    is submitted in writing to a contracting officer by a contractor or
    subcontractor at any tier, such claim shall be considered a claim
    within the meaning of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C.
    601 et seq.).
    (f) Challenge; use of technical data; sustained; liability of
      United States for costs and fees
      (1) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's
    challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to
    use such technical data is sustained - 
        (A) the restriction on the right of the United States to use
      the technical data shall be cancelled; and
        (B) if the asserted restriction is found not to be
      substantially justified, the contractor or subcontractor, as
      appropriate, shall be liable to the United States for payment of
      the cost to the United States of reviewing the asserted
      restriction and the fees and other expenses (as defined in
      section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the United States
      in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special
      circumstances would make such payment unjust.

      (2) If, upon final disposition, the contracting officer's
    challenge to the restriction on the right of the United States to
    use such technical data is not sustained - 
        (A) the United States shall continue to be bound by the
      restriction; and
        (B) the United States shall be liable for payment to the party
      asserting the restriction for fees and other expenses (as defined
      in section 2412(d)(2)(A) of title 28) incurred by the party
      asserting the restriction in defending the asserted restriction
      if the challenge by the United States is found not to be made in
      good faith.

      directly to United States

-STATUTE-
    (a) Contract restrictions
      Each contract for the purchase of property or services made by an
    executive agency shall provide that the contractor will not - 
        (1) enter into any agreement with a subcontractor under the
      contract that has the effect of unreasonably restricting sales by
      the subcontractor directly to the United States of any item or
      process (including computer software) made or furnished by the
      subcontractor under the contract (or any follow-on production
      contract); or
        (2) otherwise act to restrict unreasonably the ability of a
      subcontractor to make sales to the United States described in
      clause (1).
    (b) Rights under law
      This section does not prohibit a contractor from asserting rights
    it otherwise has under law.
    (c) Inapplicability to certain contracts
      This section does not apply to a contract for an amount that is
    not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold.
    (d) Inapplicability when Government treated similarly to other
      purchasers
      An agreement between the contractor in a contract for the
    acquisition of commercial items and a subcontractor under such
    contract that restricts sales by such subcontractor directly to
    persons other than the contractor may not be considered to
    unreasonably restrict sales by that subcontractor to the United
    States in violation of the provision included in such contract
    pursuant to subsection (a) of this section if the agreement does
    not result in the Federal Government being treated differently with
    regard to the restriction than any other prospective purchaser of
    such commercial items from that subcontractor.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253h. Task and delivery order contracts: general authority

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to award
      Subject to the requirements of this section, section 253j of this
    title, and other applicable law, the head of an executive agency
    may enter into a task or delivery order contract (as defined in
    section 253k of this title) for procurement of services or
    property.
    (b) Solicitation
      The solicitation for a task or delivery order contract shall
    include the following:
        (1) The period of the contract, including the number of options
      to extend the contract and the period for which the contract may
      be extended under each option, if any.
        (2) The maximum quantity or dollar value of the services or
      property to be procured under the contract.
        (3) A statement of work, specifications, or other description
      that reasonably describes the general scope, nature, complexity,
      and purposes of the services or property to be procured under the
      contract.
    (c) Applicability of restriction on use of noncompetitive
      procedures
      The head of an executive agency may use procedures other than
    competitive procedures to enter into a task or delivery order
    contract under this section only if an exception in subsection (c)
    of section 253 of this title applies to the contract and the use of
    such procedures is approved in accordance with subsection (f) of
    such section.
    (d) Single and multiple contract awards
      (1) The head of an executive agency may exercise the authority
    provided in this section - 
        (A) to award a single task or delivery order contract; or
        (B) if the solicitation states that the head of the executive
      agency has the option to do so, to award separate task or
      delivery order contracts for the same or similar services or
      property to two or more sources.

      (2) No determination under section 253(b) of this title is
    required for an award of multiple task or delivery order contracts
    under paragraph (1)(B).
      (3)(A) No task or delivery order contract in an amount estimated
    to exceed $100,000,000 (including all options) may be awarded to a
    single source unless the head of the executive agency determines in
    writing that - 
        (i) the task or delivery orders expected under the contract are
      so integrally related that only a single source can reasonably
      perform the work;
        (ii) the contract provides only for firm, fixed price task
      orders or delivery orders for - 
          (I) products for which unit prices are established in the
        contract; or
          (II) services for which prices are established in the
        contract for the specific tasks to be performed;

        (iii) only one source is qualified and capable of performing
      the work at a reasonable price to the government; or
        (iv) because of exceptional circumstances, it is necessary in
      the public interest to award the contract to a single source.

      (B) The head of the executive agency shall notify Congress within
    30 days after any determination under subparagraph (A)(iv).
      (4) The regulations implementing this subsection shall - 
        (A) establish a preference for awarding, to the maximum extent
      practicable, multiple task or delivery order contracts for the
      same or similar services or property under the authority of
      paragraph (1)(B); and
        (B) establish criteria for determining when award of multiple
      task or delivery order contracts would not be in the best
      interest of the Federal Government.
    (e) Contract modifications
      A task or delivery order may not increase the scope, period, or
    maximum value of the task or delivery order contract under which
    the order is issued. The scope, period, or maximum value of the
    contract may be increased only by modification of the contract.
    (f) Inapplicability to contracts for advisory and assistance
      services
      Except as otherwise specifically provided in section 253i of this
    title, this section does not apply to a task or delivery order
    contract for the acquisition of advisory and assistance services
    (as defined in section 1105(g) of title 31).
    (g) Relationship to other contracting authority
      Nothing in this section may be construed to limit or expand any
    authority of the head of an executive agency or the Administrator
    of General Services to enter into schedule, multiple award, or task
    or delivery order contracts under any other provision of law.

      The period of a task order contract entered into under this
    section, including all periods of extensions of the contract under
    options, modifications, or otherwise, may not exceed five years
    unless a longer period is specifically authorized in a law that is
    applicable to such contract.
    (c) Content of notice
      The notice required by section 416 of this title and section
    637(e) of title 15 shall reasonably and fairly describe the general
    scope, magnitude, and duration of the proposed task order contract

      (1) The solicitation shall include the information (regarding

      (1) The head of an executive agency may, on the basis of one
    solicitation, award separate task order contracts under this
    section for the same or similar services to two or more sources if
    the solicitation states that the head of the executive agency has
    the option to do so.

    assistance services to be entered into under the authority of this
    section, the contract period is to exceed three years and the

      the offerers is capable of providing the services required at the
      level of quality required.

      (3) Paragraph (2) does not apply in the case of a solicitation
    for which the head of the executive agency concerned determines in
    writing that, because the services required under the contract are
    unique or highly specialized, it is not practicable to award more
    than one contract.
    (f) Contract modifications
      (1) A task order may not increase the scope, period, or maximum
    value of the task order contract under which the order is issued.

    contract pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, a contract
    entered into by the head of an executive agency under this section
    may be extended on a sole-source basis for a period not exceeding
    six months if the head of such executive agency determines that - 
        (A) the award of a follow-on contract has been delayed by
      circumstances that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time
      the initial contract was entered into; and
        (B) the extension is necessary in order to ensure continuity of
      the receipt of services pending the award of, and commencement of
      performance under, the follow-on contract.

      (2) A task order contract may be extended under the authority of
    paragraph (1) only once and only in accordance with the limitations
    and requirements of this subsection.
    (h) Inapplicability to certain contracts
      This section does not apply to a contract for the acquisition of
    property or services that includes acquisition of advisory and
    assistance services if the head of the executive agency entering
    into such contract determines that, under the contract, advisory
    and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a
    significant component of, the contract.
    (i) "Advisory and assistance services" defined
      In this section, the term "advisory and assistance services" has

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253j. Task and delivery order contracts: orders

-STATUTE-
    (a) Issuance of orders
      The following actions are not required for issuance of a task or
    delivery order under a task or delivery order contract:
        (1) A separate notice for such order under section 416 of this
      title or section 637(e) of title 15.
        (2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a
      competition (or a waiver of competition approved in accordance
      with section 253(f) of this title) that is separate from that
      used for entering into the contract.
    (b) Multiple award contracts
      When multiple contracts are awarded under section 253h(d)(1)(B)
    or 253i(e) of this title, all contractors awarded such contracts
    shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered, pursuant to
    procedures set forth in the contracts, for each task or delivery
    order in excess of $2,500 that is to be issued under any of the
    contracts unless - 
        (1) the executive agency's need for the services or property
      ordered is of such unusual urgency that providing such
      opportunity to all such contractors would result in unacceptable
      delays in fulfilling that need;
        (2) only one such contractor is capable of providing the
      services or property required at the level of quality required
      because the services or property ordered are unique or highly
      specialized;
        (3) the task or delivery order should be issued on a sole-
      source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because
      it is a logical follow-on to a task or delivery order already
      issued on a competitive basis; or
        (4) it is necessary to place the order with a particular
      contractor in order to satisfy a minimum guarantee.
    (c) Statement of work
      A task or delivery order shall include a statement of work that
    clearly specifies all tasks to be performed or property to be
    delivered under the order.
    (d) Enhanced competition for orders in excess of $5,000,000
      In the case of a task or delivery order in excess of $5,000,000,
    the requirement to provide all contractors a fair opportunity to be
    considered under subsection (b) is not met unless all such
    contractors are provided, at a minimum - 
        (1) a notice of the task or delivery order that includes a
      clear statement of the executive agency's requirements;
        (2) a reasonable period of time to provide a proposal in
      response to the notice;
        (3) disclosure of the significant factors and subfactors,
      including cost or price, that the executive agency expects to
      consider in evaluating such proposals, and their relative
      importance;
        (4) in the case of an award that is to be made on a best value
      basis, a written statement documenting the basis for the award
      and the relative importance of quality and price or cost factors;
      and
        (5) an opportunity for a post-award debriefing consistent with
      the requirements of section 253b(e) of this title.
    (e) Protests
      (1) A protest is not authorized in connection with the issuance
    or proposed issuance of a task or delivery order except for - 
        (A) a protest on the ground that the order increases the scope,
      period, or maximum value of the contract under which the order is
      issued; or
        (B) a protest of an order valued in excess of $10,000,000.

      (2) Notwithstanding section 3556 of title 31, the Comptroller
    General of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of a
    protest authorized under paragraph (1)(B).
      (3) This subsection shall be in effect for three years, beginning
    on the date that is 120 days after January 28, 2008.
    (f) Task and delivery order ombudsman
      The head of each executive agency who awards multiple task or
    delivery order contracts pursuant to section 253h(d)(1)(B) or
    253i(e) of this title shall appoint or designate a task and
    delivery order ombudsman who shall be responsible for reviewing
    complaints from the contractors on such contracts and ensuring that
    all of the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be
    considered for task or delivery orders when required under
    subsection (b) of this section. The task and delivery order
    ombudsman shall be a senior agency official who is independent of
    the contracting officer for the contracts and may be the executive
    agency's competition advocate.
    (g) Applicability
      This section applies to task and delivery order contracts entered
    into under sections 253h and 253i of this title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 253m. Design-build selection procedures

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authorization
      Unless the traditional acquisition approach of design-bid-build
    established under sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40 is used or
    another acquisition procedure authorized by law is used, the head
    of an executive agency shall use the two-phase selection procedures
    authorized in this section for entering into a contract for the
    design and construction of a public building, facility, or work
    when a determination is made under subsection (b) of this section
    that the procedures are appropriate for use.
    (b) Criteria for use
      A contracting officer shall make a determination whether two-
    phase selection procedures are appropriate for use for entering
    into a contract for the design and construction of a public
    building, facility, or work when the contracting officer
    anticipates that three or more offers will be received for such
    contract, design work must be performed before an offeror can
    develop a price or cost proposal for such contract, the offeror
    will incur a substantial amount of expense in preparing the offer,
    and the contracting officer has considered information such as the
    following:
        (1) The extent to which the project requirements have been
      adequately defined.
        (2) The time constraints for delivery of the project.
        (3) The capability and experience of potential contractors.
        (4) The suitability of the project for use of the two-phase
      selection procedures.
        (5) The capability of the agency to manage the two-phase
      selection process.
        (6) Other criteria established by the agency.
    (c) Procedures described
      Two-phase selection procedures consist of the following:
        (1) The agency develops, either in-house or by contract, a
      scope of work statement for inclusion in the solicitation that
      defines the project and provides prospective offerors with
      sufficient information regarding the Government's requirements
      (which may include criteria and preliminary design, budget
      parameters, and schedule or delivery requirements) to enable the
      offerors to submit proposals which meet the Government's needs.
      If the agency contracts for development of the scope of work
      statement, the agency shall contract for architectural and
      engineering services as defined by and in accordance with
      sections 1101 to 1104 of title 40.
        (2) The contracting officer solicits phase-one proposals that -
      
          (A) include information on the offeror's - 
            (i) technical approach; and
            (ii) technical qualifications; and

          (B) do not include - 
            (i) detailed design information; or
            (ii) cost or price information.

        (3) The evaluation factors to be used in evaluating phase-one
      proposals are stated in the solicitation and include specialized
      experience and technical competence, capability to perform, past
      performance of the offeror's team (including the architect-
      engineer and construction members of the team) and other
      appropriate factors, except that cost-related or price-related
      evaluation factors are not permitted. Each solicitation
      establishes the relative importance assigned to the evaluation
      factors and subfactors that must be considered in the evaluation
      of phase-one proposals. The agency evaluates phase-one proposals
      on the basis of the phase-one evaluation factors set forth in the
      solicitation.
        (4) The contracting officer selects as the most highly
      qualified the number of offerors specified in the solicitation to
      provide the property or services under the contract and requests
      the selected offerors to submit phase-two competitive proposals
      that include technical proposals and cost or price information.
      Each solicitation establishes with respect to phase two - 
          (A) the technical submission for the proposal, including
        design concepts or proposed solutions to requirements addressed
        within the scope of work (or both), and
          (B) the evaluation factors and subfactors, including cost or
        price, that must be considered in the evaluations of proposals
        in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section
        253a of this title.

      The contracting officer separately evaluates the submissions
      described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).
        (5) The agency awards the contract in accordance with section
      253b of this title.
    (d) Solicitation to state number of offerors to be selected for
      phase-two requests for competitive proposals
      A solicitation issued pursuant to the procedures described in
    subsection (c) of this section shall state the maximum number of
    offerors that are to be selected to submit competitive proposals
    pursuant to subsection (c)(4) of this section. The maximum number
    specified in the solicitation shall not exceed 5 unless the agency
    determines with respect to an individual solicitation that a
    specified number greater than 5 is in the Government's interest and
    is consistent with the purposes and objectives of the two-phase
    selection process.
    (e) Requirement for guidance and regulations
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include guidance - 
        (1) regarding the factors that may be considered in determining
      whether the two-phase contracting procedures authorized by
      subsection (a) of this section are appropriate for use in
      individual contracting situations;
        (2) regarding the factors that may be used in selecting
      contractors; and
        (3) providing for a uniform approach to be used Government-
      wide.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Contracts awarded using procedures other than sealed-bid
      procedures
      Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, contracts
    awarded after using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures may
    be of any type which in the opinion of the agency head will promote
    the best interests of the Government. Every contract awarded after
    using procedures other than sealed-bid procedures shall contain a
    suitable warranty, as determined by the agency head, by the
    contractor that no person or selling agency has been employed or
    retained to solicit or secure such contract upon an agreement or
    understanding for a commission, percentage, brokerage, or
    contingent fee, excepting bona fide employees or bona fide
    established commercial or selling agencies maintained by the
    contractor for the purpose of securing business, for the breach or
    violation of which warranty the Government shall have the right to
    annul such contract without liability or in its discretion to
    deduct from the contract price or consideration the full amount of
    such commission, percentage, brokerage, or contingent fee. The
    preceding sentence does not apply to a contract for an amount that
    is not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold or to a
    contract for the acquisition of commercial items.
    (b) Barred contracts; fee limitation; determination of use; advance
      notification
      The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting shall
    not be used, and in the case of a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract
    the fee shall not exceed 10 percent of the estimated cost of the
    contract, exclusive of the fee, as determined by the agency head at
    the time of entering into such contract (except that a fee not in
    excess of 15 percent of such estimated cost is authorized in any
    such contract for experimental, developmental, or research work and
    that a fee inclusive of the contractor's costs and not in excess of
    6 percent of the estimated cost, exclusive of fees, as determined
    by the agency head at the time of entering into the contract, of
    the project to which such fee is applicable is authorized in
    contracts for architectural or engineering services relating to any
    public works or utility project). All cost and cost-plus-a-fixed-
    fee contracts shall provide for advance notification by the
    contractor to the procuring agency of any subcontract thereunder on
    a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee basis and of any fixed-price subcontract or
    purchase order which exceeds in dollar amount either the simplified
    acquisition threshold or 5 percent of the total estimated cost of
    the prime contract; and a procuring agency, through any authorized
    representative thereof, shall have the right to inspect the plans
    and to audit the books and records of any prime contractor or
    subcontractor engaged in the performance of a cost or cost-plus-a-
    fixed-fee contract.

                         EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 13201                     
      Ex. Ord. No. 13201, Feb. 17, 2001, 66 F.R. 11221, which related
    to notification of employee rights concerning payment of union dues
    or fees, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13496, Sec. 13, Jan. 30, 2009,
    74 F.R. 6110, set out below.

     EX. ORD. NO. 13496. NOTIFICATION OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UNDER FEDERAL
                                LABOR LAWS
      Ex. Ord. No. 13496, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6107, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq.,
    and in order to ensure the economical and efficient administration
    and completion of Government contracts, it is hereby ordered that:
      Section 1. Policy. This order is designed to promote economy and
    efficiency in Government procurement. When the Federal Government
    contracts for goods or services, it has a proprietary interest in
    ensuring that those contracts will be performed by contractors
    whose work will not be interrupted by labor unrest. The attainment
    of industrial peace is most easily achieved and workers'
    productivity is enhanced when workers are well informed of their
    rights under Federal labor laws, including the National Labor
    Relations Act (Act), 29 U.S.C. 151 et seq. As the Act recognizes,
    "encouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining
    and . . . protecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of
    association, self-organization, and designation of representatives
    of their own choosing, for the purpose of negotiating the terms and
    conditions of their employment or other mutual aid or protection"
    will "eliminate the causes of certain substantial obstructions to
    the free flow of commerce" and "mitigate and eliminate these
    obstructions when they have occurred." 29 U.S.C. 151. Relying on
    contractors whose employees are informed of such rights under
    Federal labor laws facilitates the efficient and economical
    completion of the Federal Government's contracts.
      Sec. 2. Contract Clause. Except in contracts exempted in
    accordance with section 3 of this order, all Government contracting
    departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law,
    include the following provisions in every Government contract,
    other than collective bargaining agreements as defined in 5 U.S.C.
    7103(a)(8) and purchases under the simplified acquisition threshold
    as defined in the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, 41
    U.S.C. 403.
      "1. During the term of this contract, the contractor agrees to
    post a notice, of such size and in such form, and containing such
    content as the Secretary of Labor shall prescribe, in conspicuous
    places in and about its plants and offices where employees covered
    by the National Labor Relations Act engage in activities relating
    to the performance of the contract, including all places where
    notices to employees are customarily posted both physically and
    electronically. The notice shall include the information contained
    in the notice published by the Secretary of Labor in the Federal
    Register (Secretary's Notice).
      "2. The contractor will comply with all provisions of the
    Secretary's Notice, and related rules, regulations, and orders of
    the Secretary of Labor.
      "3. In the event that the contractor does not comply with any of
    the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) or (2) above, this
    contract may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in
    part, and the contractor may be declared ineligible for further
    Government contracts in accordance with procedures authorized in or
    adopted pursuant to Executive Order [number as provided by the
    Federal Register [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]].
    Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided in
    Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register
    [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]], or by rule,
    regulation, or order of the Secretary of Labor, or as are otherwise
    provided by law.
      "4. The contractor will include the provisions of paragraphs (1)
    through (3) above in every subcontract entered into in connection
    with this contract (unless exempted by rules, regulations, or
    orders of the Secretary of Labor issued pursuant to section 3 of
    Executive Order [number as provided by the Federal Register
    [13496]] of [insert new date [Jan. 30, 2009]]) so that such
    provisions will be binding upon each subcontractor. The contractor
    will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may
    be directed by the Secretary of Labor as a means of enforcing such
    provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-
    compliance: Provided, however, that if the contractor becomes
    involved in litigation with a subcontractor, or is threatened with
    such involvement, as a result of such direction, the contractor may
    request the United States to enter into such litigation to protect
    the interests of the United States."
      Sec. 3. Administration.
      (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) shall be responsible for
    the administration and enforcement of this order. The Secretary
    shall adopt such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are
    necessary and appropriate to achieve the purposes of this order.
      (b) Within 120 days of the effective date of this order, the
    Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking to prescribe the size, form,
    and content of the notice to be posted by a contractor under
    paragraph 1 of the contract clause described in section 2 of this
    order. Such notice shall describe the rights of employees under
    Federal labor laws, consistent with the policy set forth in section
    1 of this order.
      (c) Whenever the Secretary finds that an act of Congress,
    clarification of existing law by the courts or the National Labor
    Relations Board, or other circumstances make modification of the
    contractual provisions set out in subsection (a) of this section
    necessary to achieve the purposes of this order, the Secretary
    promptly shall issue such rules, regulations, or orders as are
    needed to cause the substitution or addition of appropriate
    contractual provisions in Government contracts thereafter entered
    into.
      Sec. 4. Exemptions. (a) If the Secretary finds that the
    application of any of the requirements of this order would not
    serve the purposes of this order or would impair the ability of the
    Government to procure goods or services on an economical and
    efficient basis, the Secretary may exempt a contracting department
    or agency or group of departments or agencies from the requirements
    of any or all of the provisions of this order with respect to a
    particular contract or subcontract or any class of contracts or
    subcontracts.
      (b) The Secretary may, if the Secretary finds that special
    circumstances require an exemption in order to serve the national
    interest, exempt a contracting department or agency from the
    requirements of any or all of the provisions of section 2 of this
    order with respect to a particular contract or subcontract or class
    of contracts or subcontracts.
      Sec. 5. Investigation.
      (a) The Secretary may investigate any Government contractor,
    subcontractor, or vendor to determine whether the contractual
    provisions required by section 2 of this order have been violated.
      Such investigations shall be conducted in accordance with
    procedures established by the Secretary.
      (b) The Secretary shall receive and investigate complaints by
    employees of a Government contractor or subcontractor, where such
    complaints allege a failure to perform or a violation of the
    contractual provisions required by section 2 of this order.
      Sec. 6. Compliance.
      (a) The Secretary, or any agency or officer in the executive
    branch lawfully designated by rule, regulation, or order of the
    Secretary, may hold such hearings, public or private, regarding
    compliance with this order as the Secretary may deem advisable.
      (b) The Secretary may hold hearings, or cause hearings to be
    held, in accordance with subsection (a) of this section, prior to
    imposing, ordering, or recommending the imposition of sanctions
    under this order. Neither an order for cancellation, termination,
    or suspension of any contract or debarment of any contractor from
    further Government contracts under section 7(b) of this order nor
    the inclusion of a contractor on a published list of noncomplying
    contractors under section 7(c) of this order shall be carried out
    without affording the contractor an opportunity for a hearing.
      Sec. 7. Remedies. In accordance with such rules, regulations, or
    orders as the Secretary may issue or adopt, the Secretary may:
      (a) after consulting with the contracting department or agency,
    direct that department or agency to cancel, terminate, suspend, or
    cause to be cancelled, terminated, or suspended, any contract, or
    any portion or portions thereof, for failure of the contractor to
    comply with the contractual provisions required by section 2 of
    this order; contracts may be cancelled, terminated, or suspended
    absolutely, or continuance of contracts may be conditioned upon
    future compliance: Provided, that before issuing a directive under
    this subsection, the Secretary shall provide the head of the
    contracting department or agency an opportunity to offer written
    objections to the issuance of such a directive, which objections
    shall include a complete statement of reasons for the objections,
    among which reasons shall be a finding that completion of the
    contract is essential to the agency's mission: And provided
    further, that no directive shall be issued by the Secretary under
    this subsection so long as the head of the contracting department
    or agency, or his or her designee, continues to object to the
    issuance of such directive;
      (b) after consulting with each affected contracting department or
    agency, provide that one or more contracting departments or
    agencies shall refrain from entering into further contracts, or
    extensions or other modifications of existing contracts, with any
    noncomplying contractor, until such contractor has satisfied the
    Secretary that such contractor has complied with and will carry out
    the provisions of this order: Provided, that before issuing a
    directive under this subsection, the Secretary shall provide the
    head of each contracting department or agency an opportunity to
    offer written objections to the issuance of such a directive, which
    objections shall include a complete statement of reasons for the
    objections, among which reasons shall be a finding that further
    contracts or extensions or other modifications of existing
    contracts with the noncomplying contractor are essential to the
    agency's mission: And provided further, that no directive shall be
    issued by the Secretary under this subsection so long as the head
    of a contracting department or agency, or his or her designee,
    continues to object to the issuance of such directive; and
      (c) publish, or cause to be published, the names of contractors
    that have, in the judgment of the Secretary, failed to comply with
    the provisions of this order or of related rules, regulations, and
    orders of the Secretary.
      Sec. 8. Reports. Whenever the Secretary invokes section 7(a) or
    7(b) of this order, the contracting department or agency shall
    report to the Secretary the results of the action it has taken
    within such time as the Secretary shall specify.
      Sec. 9. Cooperation. Each contracting department and agency shall
    cooperate with the Secretary and provide such information and
    assistance as the Secretary may require in the performance of the
    Secretary's functions under this order.
      Sec. 10. Sufficiency of Remedies. If the Secretary finds that the
    authority vested in the Secretary by sections 5 through 9 of this
    order is not sufficient to effectuate the purposes of this order,
    the Secretary shall develop recommendations on how better to
    effectuate those purposes.

        (A) in the case of a submission by a prime contractor (or an
      offeror for a prime contract), to the contracting officer for the
      contract (or to a designated representative of the contracting
      officer); or
        (B) in the case of a submission by a subcontractor (or an
      offeror for a subcontract), to the prime contractor.

      (4) Except as provided under subsection (b) of this section, this
    section applies to contracts entered into by the head of an
    executive agency on behalf of a foreign government.
      (5) A waiver of requirements for submission of certified cost or
    pricing data that is granted under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this
    section in the case of a contract or subcontract does not waive the
    requirement under paragraph (1)(C) for submission of cost or
    pricing data in the case of subcontracts under that contract or
    subcontract unless the head of the procuring activity granting the
    waiver determines that the requirement under that paragraph should
    be waived in the case of such subcontracts and justifies in writing
    the reasons for the determination.
      (6) Upon the request of a contractor that was required to submit
    cost or pricing data under paragraph (1) in connection with a prime
    contract entered into on or before October 13, 1994, the head of
    the executive agency that entered into such contract shall modify
    the contract to reflect subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C)(ii) of
    paragraph (1). All such modifications shall be made without
    requiring consideration.
      (7) Effective on October 1 of each year that is divisible by 5,
    each amount set forth in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted to the
    amount that is equal to the fiscal year 1994 constant dollar value
    of the amount set forth. Any amount, as so adjusted, that is not
    evenly divisible by $50,000 shall be rounded to the nearest
    multiple of $50,000. In the case of an amount that is evenly
    divisible by $25,000 but not evenly divisible by $50,000, the
    amount shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of $50,000.
    (b) Exceptions
      (1) In general
        Submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not be
      required under subsection (a) of this section in the case of a
      contract, a subcontract, or a modification of a contract or
      subcontract - 
          (A) for which the price agreed upon is based on - 
            (i) adequate price competition; or
            (ii) prices set by law or regulation;

          (B) for the acquisition of a commercial item; or
          (C) in an exceptional case when the head of the procuring
        activity, without delegation, determines that the requirements
        of this section may be waived and justifies in writing the
        reasons for such determination.
      (2) Modifications of contracts and subcontracts for commercial
        items
        In the case of a modification of a contract or subcontract for
      a commercial item that is not covered by the exception to the
      submission of certified cost or pricing data in paragraph (1)(A)
      or (1)(B), submission of certified cost or pricing data shall not
      be required under subsection (a) of this section if - 
          (A) the contract or subcontract being modified is a contract
        or subcontract for which submission of certified cost or
        pricing data may not be required by reason of paragraph (1)(A)
        or (1)(B); and
          (B) the modification would not change the contract or
        subcontract, as the case may be, from a contract or subcontract
        for the acquisition of a commercial item to a contract or
        subcontract for the acquisition of an item other than a
        commercial item.
    (c) Cost or pricing data on below-threshold contracts
      (1) Authority to require submission
        Subject to paragraph (2), when certified cost or pricing data
      are not required to be submitted by subsection (a) of this
      section for a contract, subcontract, or modification of a
      contract or subcontract, such data may nevertheless be required
      to be submitted by the head of the procuring activity, but only
      if the head of the procuring activity determines that such data
      are necessary for the evaluation by the agency of the
      reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or
      modification of a contract or subcontract. In any case in which
      the head of the procuring activity requires such data to be
      submitted under this subsection, the head of the procuring
      activity shall justify in writing the reason for such
      requirement.
      (2) Exception
        The head of the procuring activity may not require certified
      cost or pricing data to be submitted under this paragraph for any
      contract or subcontract, or modification of a contract or
      subcontract, covered by the exceptions in subparagraph (A) or (B)
      of subsection (b)(1) of this section.
      (3) Delegation of authority prohibited
        The head of a procuring activity may not delegate the functions
      under this paragraph.
    (d) Submission of other information
      (1) Authority to require submission
        When certified cost or pricing data are not required to be
      submitted under this section for a contract, subcontract, or
      modification of a contract or subcontract, the contracting
      officer shall require submission of data other than certified
      cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine the
      reasonableness of the price of the contract, subcontract, or
      modification of the contract or subcontract. Except in the case
      of a contract or subcontract covered by the exceptions in
      subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, the contracting officer
      shall require that the data submitted include, at a minimum,
      appropriate information on the prices at which the same item or
      similar items have previously been sold that is adequate for
      evaluating the reasonableness of the price for the procurement.
      (2) Limitations on authority
        The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include the following
      provisions regarding the types of information that contracting
      officers may require under paragraph (1):
          (A) Reasonable limitations on requests for sales data
        relating to commercial items.
          (B) A requirement that a contracting officer limit, to the
        maximum extent practicable, the scope of any request for
        information relating to commercial items from an offeror to
        only that information that is in the form regularly maintained
        by the offeror in commercial operations.
          (C) A statement that any information received relating to
        commercial items that is exempt from disclosure under section
        552(b) of title 5 shall not be disclosed by the Federal
        Government.
    (e) Price reductions for defective cost or pricing data
      (1)(A) A prime contract (or change or modification to a prime
    contract) under which a certificate under subsection (a)(2) of this
    section is required shall contain a provision that the price of the
    contract to the United States, including profit or fee, shall be
    adjusted to exclude any significant amount by which it may be
    determined by the head of the executive agency that such price was
    increased because the contractor (or any subcontractor required to
    make available such a certificate) submitted defective cost or
    pricing data.
      (B) For the purposes of this section, defective cost or pricing
    data are cost or pricing data which, as of the date of agreement on
    the price of the contract (or another date agreed upon between the
    parties), were inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent. If for
    purposes of the preceding sentence the parties agree upon a date
    other than the date of agreement on the price of the contract, the
    date agreed upon by the parties shall be as close to the date of
    agreement on the price of the contract as is practicable.
      (2) In determining for purposes of a contract price adjustment
    under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) whether, and
    to what extent, a contract price was increased because the
    contractor (or a subcontractor) submitted defective cost or pricing
    data, it shall be a defense that the United States did not rely on
    the defective data submitted by the contractor or subcontractor.
      (3) It is not a defense to an adjustment of the price of a
    contract under a contract provision required by paragraph (1) that -
     
        (A) the price of the contract would not have been modified even
      if accurate, complete, and current cost or pricing data had been
      submitted by the contractor or subcontractor because the
      contractor or subcontractor - 
          (i) was the sole source of the property or services procured;
        or
          (ii) otherwise was in a superior bargaining position with
        respect to the property or services procured;

        (B) the contracting officer should have known that the cost or
      pricing data in issue were defective even though the contractor
      or subcontractor took no affirmative action to bring the
      character of the data to the attention of the contracting
      officer;
        (C) the contract was based on an agreement between the
      contractor and the United States about the total cost of the
      contract and there was no agreement about the cost of each item
      procured under such contract; or
        (D) the prime contractor or subcontractor did not submit a
      certification of cost or pricing data relating to the contract as
      required under subsection (a)(2) of this section.

      (4)(A) A contractor shall be allowed to offset an amount against
    the amount of a contract price adjustment under a contract
    provision required by paragraph (1) if - 
        (i) the contractor certifies to the contracting officer (or to
      a designated representative of the contracting officer) that, to
      the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, the contractor
      is entitled to the offset; and
        (ii) the contractor proves that the cost or pricing data were
      available before the date of agreement on the price of the
      contract (or price of the modification), or, if applicable
      consistent with paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon
      between the parties, and that the data were not submitted as
      specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section before such date.

      (B) A contractor shall not be allowed to offset an amount
    otherwise authorized to be offset under subparagraph (A) if - 
        (i) the certification under subsection (a)(2) of this section
      with respect to the cost or pricing data involved was known to be
      false when signed; or
        (ii) the United States proves that, had the cost or pricing
      data referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) been submitted to the
      United States before the date of agreement on the price of the
      contract (or price of the modification) or, if applicable under
      paragraph (1)(B), another date agreed upon between the parties,
      the submission of such cost or pricing data would not have
      resulted in an increase in that price in the amount to be offset.
    (f) Interest and penalties for certain overpayments
      (1) If the United States makes an overpayment to a contractor
    under a contract with an executive agency subject to this section
    and the overpayment was due to the submission by the contractor of
    defective cost or pricing data, the contractor shall be liable to
    the United States - 
        (A) for interest on the amount of such overpayment, to be
      computed - 
          (i) for the period beginning on the date the overpayment was
        made to the contractor and ending on the date the contractor
        repays the amount of such overpayment to the United States; and
          (ii) at the current rate prescribed by the Secretary of the
        Treasury under section 6621 of title 26; and

        (B) if the submission of such defective data was a knowing
      submission, for an additional amount equal to the amount of the
      overpayment.

      (2) Any liability under this subsection of a contractor that
    submits cost or pricing data but refuses to submit the
    certification required by subsection (a)(2) of this section with
    respect to the cost or pricing data shall not be affected by the
    refusal to submit such certification.
    (g) Right of United States to examine contractor records
      For the purpose of evaluating the accuracy, completeness, and
    currency of cost or pricing data required to be submitted by this
    section, an executive agency shall have the authority provided by
    section 254d(a)(2) of this title.
    (h) Definitions
      In this section:
      (1) Cost or pricing data
        The term "cost or pricing data" means all facts that, as of the
      date of agreement on the price of a contract (or the price of a
      contract modification) or, if applicable consistent with
      subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section, another date agreed upon
      between the parties, a prudent buyer or seller would reasonably
      expect to affect price negotiations significantly. Such term does
      not include information that is judgmental, but does include the
      factual information from which a judgment was derived.
      (2) Subcontract
        The term "subcontract" includes a transfer of commercial items
      between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor or
      a subcontractor.
      (3) Commercial item
        The term "commercial item" has the meaning provided such term
      by section 403(12) of this title.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 254c. Multiyear contracts

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority
      An executive agency may enter into a multiyear contract for the
    acquisition of property or services if - 
        (1) funds are available and obligated for such contract, for
      the full period of the contract or for the first fiscal year in
      which the contract is in effect, and for the estimated costs
      associated with any necessary termination of such contract; and
        (2) the executive agency determines that - 
          (A) the need for the property or services is reasonably firm
        and continuing over the period of the contract; and
          (B) a multiyear contract will serve the best interests of the
        United States by encouraging full and open competition or
        promoting economy in administration, performance, and operation
        of the agency's programs.
    (b) Termination clause
      A multiyear contract entered into under the authority of this
    section shall include a clause that provides that the contract
    shall be terminated if funds are not made available for the
    continuation of such contract in any fiscal year covered by the
    contract. Amounts available for paying termination costs shall
    remain available for such purpose until the costs associated with
    termination of the contract are paid.
    (c) Cancellation ceiling notice
      Before any contract described in subsection (a) of this section
    that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in
    excess of $10,000,000 may be awarded, the executive agency shall
    give written notification of the proposed contract and of the
    proposed cancellation ceiling for that contract to the Congress,
    and such contract may not then be awarded until the end of a period
    of 30 days beginning on the date of such notification.
    (d) Multiyear contract defined
      For the purposes of this section, a multiyear contract is a
    contract for the purchase of property or services for more than
    one, but not more than five, program years. Such a contract may
    provide that performance under the contract during the second and
    subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the
    appropriation of funds and (if it does so provide) may provide for
    a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if such
    appropriations are not made.
    (e) Rule of construction
      Nothing in this section is intended to modify or affect any other
    provision of law that authorizes multiyear contracts.

    Sec. 254d. Examination of records of contractor

-STATUTE-
    (a) Agency authority
      (1) The head of an executive agency, acting through an authorized
    representative, is authorized to inspect the plant and audit the
    records of - 
        (A) a contractor performing a cost-reimbursement, incentive,
      time-and-materials, labor-hour, or price-redeterminable contract,
      or any combination of such contracts, made by that executive
      agency under this subchapter; and
        (B) a subcontractor performing any cost-reimbursement,
      incentive, time-and-materials, labor-hour, or price-
      redeterminable subcontract or any combination of such
      subcontracts under a contract referred to in subparagraph (A).

      (2) The head of an executive agency, acting through an authorized
    representative, is authorized, for the purpose of evaluating the
    accuracy, completeness, and currency of certified cost or pricing
    data required to be submitted pursuant to section 254b of this
    title with respect to a contract or subcontract, to examine all
    records of the contractor or subcontractor related to - 
        (A) the proposal for the contract or subcontract;
        (B) the discussions conducted on the proposal;
        (C) pricing of the contract or subcontract; or
        (D) performance of the contract or subcontract.
    (b) Subpoena power
      (1) The Inspector General of an executive agency appointed under
    section 3 or 8G (!1) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.
    App.) or, upon request of the head of an executive agency, the
    Director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency (or any successor
    agency) of the Department of Defense or the Inspector General of
    the General Services Administration may require by subpoena the
    production of records of a contractor, access to which is provided
    for that executive agency by subsection (a) of this section.

      (2) Any such subpoena, in the case of contumacy or refusal to
    obey, shall be enforceable by order of an appropriate United States
    district court.
      (3) The authority provided by paragraph (1) may not be delegated.
      (4) In the year following a year in which authority provided in
    paragraph (1) is exercised for an executive agency, the head of the
    executive agency shall submit to the Committee on Governmental
    Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Government Operations of
    the House of Representatives a report on the exercise of such
    authority during such preceding year and the reasons why such
    authority was exercised in any instance.
    (c) Comptroller General authority
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), each contract awarded
    after using procedures other than sealed bid procedures shall
    provide that the Comptroller General and his representatives are
    authorized to examine any records of the contractor, or any of its
    subcontractors, that directly pertain to, and involve transactions
    relating to, the contract or subcontract and to interview any
    current employee regarding such transactions.
      (2) Paragraph (1) does not apply to a contract or subcontract
    with a foreign contractor or foreign subcontractor if the executive
    agency concerned determines, with the concurrence of the
    Comptroller General or his designee, that the application of that
    paragraph to the contract or subcontract would not be in the public
    interest. However, the concurrence of the Comptroller General or
    his designee is not required - 
        (A) where the contractor or subcontractor is a foreign
      government or agency thereof or is precluded by the laws of the
      country involved from making its records available for
      examination; and
        (B) where the executive agency determines, after taking into
      account the price and availability of the property and services
      from United States sources, that the public interest would be
      best served by not applying paragraph (1).

      (3) Paragraph (1) may not be construed to require a contractor or
    subcontractor to create or maintain any record that the contractor
    or subcontractor does not maintain in the ordinary course of
    business or pursuant to another provision of law.
    (d) Limitation on audits relating to indirect costs
      An executive agency may not perform an audit of indirect costs
    under a contract, subcontract, or modification before or after
    entering into the contract, subcontract, or modification in any
    case in which the contracting officer determines that the
    objectives of the audit can reasonably be met by accepting the
    results of an audit that was conducted by any other department or
    agency of the Federal Government within one year preceding the date
    of the contracting officer's determination.
    (e) Limitation
      The authority of an executive agency under subsection (a) of this
    section, and the authority of the Comptroller General under
    subsection (c) of this section, with respect to a contract or
    subcontract shall expire three years after final payment under such
    contract or subcontract.
    (f) Inapplicability to certain contracts
      This section does not apply to the following contracts:
        (1) Contracts for utility services at rates not exceeding those
      established to apply uniformly to the public, plus any applicable
      reasonable connection charge.
        (2) A contract or subcontract that is not greater than the
      simplified acquisition threshold.
    (g) Form of original record storage
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a
    contractor from duplicating or storing original records in
    electronic form.
    (h) Use of images of original records
      An executive agency shall not require a contractor or
    subcontractor to provide original records in an audit carried out
    pursuant to this section if the contractor or subcontractor
    provides photographic or electronic images of the original records
    and meets the following requirements:
        (1) The contractor or subcontractor has established procedures
      to ensure that the imaging process preserves the integrity,
      reliability, and security of the original records.
        (2) The contractor or subcontractor maintains an effective
      indexing system to permit timely and convenient access to the
      imaged records.
        (3) The contractor or subcontractor retains the original
      records for a minimum of one year after imaging to permit
      periodic validation of the imaging systems.
    (i) "Records" defined
      In this section, the term "records" includes books, documents,
    accounting procedures and practices, and other data, regardless of
    type and regardless of whether such items are in written form, in
    the form of computer data, or in any other form.

    Sec. 255. Contract financing

-STATUTE-
    (a) Payment authority
      Any executive agency may - 
        (1) make advance, partial, progress or other payments under
      contracts for property or services made by the agency; and
        (2) insert in solicitations for procurement of property or
      services a provision limiting to small business concerns advance
      or progress payments.
    (b) Performance-based payments
      Whenever practicable, payments under subsection (a) of this
    section shall be made on any of the following bases:
        (1) Performance measured by objective, quantifiable methods
      such as delivery of acceptable items, work measurement, or
      statistical process controls.
        (2) Accomplishment of events defined in the program management
      plan.
        (3) Other quantifiable measures of results.
    (c) Payment amount
      Payments made under subsection (a) of this section may not exceed
    the unpaid contract price.
    (d) Security for advance payments
      Advance payments under subsection (a) of this section may be made
    only upon adequate security and a determination by the agency head
    that to do so would be in the public interest. Such security may be
    in the form of a lien in favor of the Government on the property
    contracted for, on the balance in an account in which such payments
    are deposited, and on such of the property acquired for performance
    of the contract as the parties may agree. This lien shall be
    paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the
    first advancement of funds without filing, notice, or any other
    action by the United States.
    (e) Conditions for progress payments
      (1) The executive agency shall ensure that any payment for work
    in progress (including materials, labor, and other items) under a
    contract of an executive agency that provides for such payments is
    commensurate with the work accomplished that meets standards
    established under the contract. The contractor shall provide such
    information and evidence as the executive agency determines
    necessary to permit the executive agency to carry out the preceding
    sentence.
      (2) The executive agency shall ensure that progress payments
    referred to in paragraph (1) are not made for more than 80 percent
    of the work accomplished under the contract so long as the
    executive agency has not made the contractual terms,
    specifications, and price definite.
      (3) This subsection applies to any contract in an amount greater
    than $25,000.
    (f) Conditions for payments for commercial items
      (1) Payments under subsection (a) of this section for commercial
    items may be made under such terms and conditions as the head of
    the executive agency determines are appropriate or customary in the
    commercial marketplace and are in the best interests of the United
    States. The head of the executive agency shall obtain adequate
    security for such payments. If the security is in the form of a
    lien in favor of the United States, such lien is paramount to all
    other liens and is effective immediately upon the first payment,
    without filing, notice, or other action by the United States.
      (2) Advance payments made under subsection (a) of this section
    for commercial items may include payments, in a total amount of not
    more than 15 percent of the contract price, in advance of any
    performance of work under the contract.
      (3) The conditions of subsections (d) and (e) of this section
    need not be applied if they would be inconsistent, as determined by
    the head of the executive agency, with commercial terms and
    conditions pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2).
    (g) Action in case of fraud
      (1) In any case in which the remedy coordination official of an
    executive agency finds that there is substantial evidence that the
    request of a contractor for advance, partial, or progress payment
    under a contract awarded by that executive agency is based on
    fraud, the remedy coordination official shall recommend that the
    executive agency reduce or suspend further payments to such
    contractor.
      (2) The head of an executive agency receiving a recommendation
    under paragraph (1) in the case of a contractor's request for
    payment under a contract shall determine whether there is
    substantial evidence that the request is based on fraud. Upon
    making such a determination, the head of the executive agency may
    reduce or suspend further payments to the contractor under such
    contract.
      (3) The extent of any reduction or suspension of payments by an
    executive agency under paragraph (2) on the basis of fraud shall be
    reasonably commensurate with the anticipated loss to the United
    States resulting from the fraud.
      (4) A written justification for each decision of the head of an
    executive agency whether to reduce or suspend payments under
    paragraph (2), and for each recommendation received by the
    executive agency in connection with such decision, shall be
    prepared and be retained in the files of the executive agency.
      (5) The head of each executive agency shall prescribe procedures
    to ensure that, before the head of the executive agency decides to
    reduce or suspend payments in the case of a contractor under
    paragraph (2), the contractor is afforded notice of the proposed
    reduction or suspension and an opportunity to submit matters to the
    executive agency in response to such proposed reduction or
    suspension.
      (6) Not later than 180 days after the date on which the head of
    an executive agency reduces or suspends payments to a contractor
    under paragraph (2), the remedy coordination official of the
    executive agency shall - 
        (A) review the determination of fraud on which the reduction or
      suspension is based; and
        (B) transmit a recommendation to the head of such executive
      agency whether the suspension or reduction should continue.

      (7) The head of each executive agency who receives
    recommendations made by a remedy coordination official of the
    executive agency to reduce or suspend payments under paragraph (2)
    during a fiscal year shall prepare for such year a report that
    contains the recommendations, the actions taken on the
    recommendations and the reasons for such actions, and an assessment
    of the effects of such actions on the Federal Government. Any such
    report shall be available to any Member of Congress upon request.
      (8) The head of an executive agency may not delegate
    responsibilities under this subsection to any person in a position
    below level IV of the Executive Schedule.
      (9) In this subsection, the term "remedy coordination official",
    with respect to an executive agency, means the person or entity in
    that executive agency who coordinates within that executive agency
    the administration of criminal, civil, administrative, and
    contractual remedies resulting from investigations of fraud or
    corruption related to procurement activities.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 256. Allowable costs

-STATUTE-
    (a) Indirect cost that violates FAR cost principle
      An executive agency shall require that a covered contract provide
    that if the contractor submits to the executive agency a proposal
    for settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any
    period after such costs have been accrued and if that proposal
    includes the submission of a cost which is unallowable because the
    cost violates a cost principle in the Federal Acquisition
    Regulation (referred to in section 421(c)(1) of this title) or an
    executive agency supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulation,
    the cost shall be disallowed.
    (b) Penalty for violation of cost principle
      (1) If the executive agency determines that a cost submitted by a
    contractor in its proposal for settlement is expressly unallowable
    under a cost principle referred to in subsection (a) of this
    section that defines the allowability of specific selected costs,
    the executive agency shall assess a penalty against the contractor
    in an amount equal to - 
        (A) the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered
      contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs
      has been submitted; plus
        (B) interest (to be computed based on provisions in the Federal
      Acquisition Regulation) to compensate the United States for the
      use of any funds which a contractor has been paid in excess of
      the amount to which the contractor was entitled.

      (2) If the executive agency determines that a proposal for
    settlement of indirect costs submitted by a contractor includes a
    cost determined to be unallowable in the case of such contractor
    before the submission of such proposal, the executive agency shall
    assess a penalty against the contractor in an amount equal to two
    times the amount of the disallowed cost allocated to covered
    contracts for which a proposal for settlement of indirect costs has
    been submitted.
    (c) Waiver of penalty
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide for a penalty
    under subsection (b) of this section to be waived in the case of a
    contractor's proposal for settlement of indirect costs when - 
        (1) the contractor withdraws the proposal before the formal
      initiation of an audit of the proposal by the Federal Government
      and resubmits a revised proposal;
        (2) the amount of unallowable costs subject to the penalty is
      insignificant; or
        (3) the contractor demonstrates, to the contracting officer's
      satisfaction, that - 
          (A) it has established appropriate policies and personnel
        training and an internal control and review system that provide
        assurances that unallowable costs subject to penalties are
        precluded from being included in the contractor's proposal for
        settlement of indirect costs; and
          (B) the unallowable costs subject to the penalty were
        inadvertently incorporated into the proposal.
    (d) Applicability of contract disputes procedure to disallowance of
      cost and assessment of penalty
      An action of an executive agency under subsection (a) or (b) of
    this section - 
        (1) shall be considered a final decision for the purposes of
      section 605 of this title; and

      title.

        (B) Costs incurred to influence (directly or indirectly)
      legislative action on any matter pending before Congress, a State

      proceeding or similar proceeding (including filing of any false
      certification) brought by the United States where the contractor
      is found liable or had pleaded nolo contendere to a charge of
      fraud or similar proceeding (including filing of a false
      certification).
        (D) Payments of fines and penalties resulting from violations
      of, or failure to comply with, Federal, State, local, or foreign
      laws and regulations, except when incurred as a result of

        a change in management control over, or ownership of, the
        contractor or a substantial portion of the contractor's assets.

        (M) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to foreign
      nationals employed by the contractor under a service contract
      performed outside the United States, to the extent that the
      amount of severance pay paid in any case exceeds the amount paid
      in the industry involved under the customary or prevailing

      the United States, as determined under the Federal Acquisition
      Regulation.
        (N) Costs of severance pay paid by the contractor to a foreign
      national employed by the contractor under a service contract
      performed in a foreign country if the termination of the
      employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing
      of, or the curtailment of activities at, a United States facility
      in that country at the request of the government of that country.
        (O) Costs incurred by a contractor in connection with any

      for a fiscal year, regardless of the contract funding source, to
      the extent that such compensation exceeds the benchmark

      the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy under section
      435 of this title.

      (2)(A) Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation and subject
    to the availability of appropriations, an executive agency, in
    awarding a covered contract, may waive the application of the
    provisions of paragraphs (1)(M) and (1)(N) to that contract if the
    executive agency determines that - 
        (i) the application of such provisions to the contract would
      adversely affect the continuation of a program, project, or
      activity that provides significant support services for employees
      of the executive agency posted outside the United States;
        (ii) the contractor has taken (or has established plans to

      severance pay by the contractor to employees under the contract
      who are foreign nationals; and
        (iii) the payment of severance pay is necessary in order to
      comply with a law that is generally applicable to a significant
      number of businesses in the country in which the foreign national
      receiving the payment performed services under the contract or is
      necessary to comply with a collective bargaining agreement.

      (B) An executive agency shall include in the solicitation for a
    covered contract a statement indicating -

      the contract; or

      waiver, the criteria to be used in granting the waiver.

      (C) An executive agency shall make the final determination
    regarding whether to grant a waiver under subparagraph (A) with
    respect to a covered contract before award of the contract.
      (3) The provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation
    implementing this section may establish appropriate definitions,
    exclusions, limitations, and qualifications. Any submission by a
    contractor of costs which are incurred by the contractor and which
    are claimed to be allowable under Department of Energy management
    and operating contracts shall be considered a "proposal for
    settlement of indirect costs incurred by the contractor for any
    period after such costs have been accrued", as used in this
    section.
    (f) Required regulations
      (1) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall contain provisions
    on the allowability of contractor costs. Such provisions shall
    define in detail and in specific terms those costs which are

      The regulations referred to in subsections (e) and (f)(1) of this
    section shall require prime contractors of a covered contract, to
    the maximum extent practicable, to apply the provisions of such
    regulations to all subcontractors of the covered contract.

    are allowable. Any such certification shall be in a form prescribed
    in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
      (2) An executive agency may, in an exceptional case, waive the
    requirement for certification under paragraph (1) in the case of
    any contract if the agency -

    with, a Federal or State statute or regulation, and (B) results in
    a disposition described in paragraph (2).
      (2) A disposition referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is any of the

    and the United States, the costs incurred by the contractor in
    connection with such proceeding that are otherwise not allowable as
    reimbursable costs under such paragraph may be allowed to the
    extent specifically provided in such agreement.
      (4) In the case of a proceeding referred to in paragraph (1) that
    is commenced by a State, the executive agency that awarded the
    covered contract involved in the proceeding may allow the costs
    incurred by the contractor in connection with such proceeding as
    reimbursable costs if the executive agency determines, in

    in subparagraph (B).
      (B)(i) The amount of the costs allowable under subparagraph (A)
    in any case may not exceed the amount equal to 80 percent of the

-EXEC-
           EX. ORD. NO. 13494. ECONOMY IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING       
      Ex. Ord. No. 13494, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6101, as amended by
    Ex. Ord. No. 13517, Sec. 2, Oct. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 57239, provided:
      By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution
    and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act, 40 U.S.C. 101 et seq., it
    is hereby ordered that:
      Section 1. To promote economy and efficiency in Government
    contracting, certain costs that are not directly related to the
    contractors' provision of goods and services to the Government
    shall be unallowable for payment, thereby directly reducing
    Government expenditures. This order is also consistent with the
    policy of the United States to remain impartial concerning any
    labor-management dispute involving Government contractors. This
    order does not restrict the manner in which recipients of Federal
    funds may expend those funds.
      Sec. 2. It is the policy of the executive branch in procuring
    goods and services that, to ensure the economical and efficient
    administration of Government contracts, contracting departments and
    agencies, when they enter into, receive proposals for, or make
    disbursements pursuant to a contract as to which certain costs are
    treated as unallowable, shall treat as unallowable the costs of any
    activities undertaken to persuade employees - whether employees of
    the recipient of the Federal disbursements or of any other entity -
    to exercise or not to exercise, or concerning the manner of
    exercising, the right to organize and bargain collectively through
    representatives of the employees' own choosing. Such unallowable
    costs shall be excluded from any billing, claim, proposal, or
    disbursement applicable to any such Federal Government contract.
      Sec. 3. Contracting departments and agencies shall treat as
    allowable costs incurred in maintaining satisfactory relations
    between the contractor and its employees (other than the costs of
    any activities undertaken to persuade employees to exercise or not
    to exercise, or concerning the manner of exercising, the right to
    organize and bargain collectively), including costs of labor
    management committees, employee publications, and other related
    activities. See 48 C.F.R. 31.205-21.
      Sec. 4. Examples of costs unallowable under section 2 of this
    order include the costs of the following activities, when they are
    undertaken to persuade employees to exercise or not to exercise, or
    concern the manner of exercising, rights to organize and bargain
    collectively:
      (a) preparing and distributing materials;
      (b) hiring or consulting legal counsel or consultants;
      (c) holding meetings (including paying the salaries of the
    attendees at meetings held for this purpose); and
      (d) planning or conducting activities by managers, supervisors,
    or union representatives during work hours.
      Sec. 5. Within 150 days of the effective date of this order, the
    Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council (FAR Council) shall adopt
    such rules and regulations and issue such orders as are deemed
    necessary and appropriate to carry out this order. Such rules,
    regulations, and orders shall minimize the costs of compliance for
    contractors and shall not interfere with the ability of contractors
    to engage in advocacy through activities for which they do not
    claim reimbursement.
      Sec. 6. Each contracting department or agency shall cooperate
    with the FAR Council and provide such information and assistance as
    the FAR Council may require in the performance of its functions
    under this order.
      Sec. 7. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with
    applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      (b) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
    or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person.
      Sec. 8. This order shall become effective immediately, and shall
    apply to contracts resulting from solicitations issued on or after
    the effective date of the action taken by the FAR Council under
    section 5 of this order.
                                                           Barack Obama.

        contracts for purchases of the commercial services in such
        category.
      "(e) Contract Quality Requirements. - The regulations prescribed
    under subsection (a) shall include provisions that - 
        "(1) permit, to the maximum extent practicable, a contractor
      under a commercial items acquisition to use the existing quality
      assurance system of the contractor as a substitute for compliance
      with an otherwise applicable requirement for the Government to
      inspect or test the commercial items before the contractor's
      tender of those items for acceptance by the Government;
        "(2) require that, to the maximum extent practicable, the

        (B) before soliciting bids or proposals for a contract in
      excess of the simplified acquisition threshold.

      (2) The head of an executive agency shall use the results of
    market research to determine whether there are commercial items or,
    to the extent that commercial items suitable to meet the executive
    agency's needs are not available, nondevelopmental items other than
    commercial items available that - 
        (A) meet the executive agency's requirements;

    Sec. 265. Contractor employees: protection from reprisal for
      disclosure of certain information

-STATUTE-
    (a) Prohibition of reprisals
      An employee of a contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or
    otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a
    Member of Congress or an authorized official of an executive agency
    or the Department of Justice information relating to a substantial
    violation of law related to a contract (including the competition
    for or negotiation of a contract).
    (b) Investigation of complaints
      A person who believes that the person has been subjected to a
    reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) of this section may submit a
    complaint to the Inspector General of the executive agency. Unless
    the Inspector General determines that the complaint is frivolous,
    the Inspector General shall investigate the complaint and, upon
    completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings
    of the investigation to the person, the contractor concerned, and
    the head of the agency. In the case of an executive agency that
    does not have an Inspector General, the duties of the Inspector
    General under this section shall be performed by an official
    designated by the head of the executive agency.
    (c) Remedy and enforcement authority
      (1) If the head of an executive agency determines that a
    contractor has subjected a person to a reprisal prohibited by
    subsection (a) of this section, the head of the executive agency
    may take one or more of the following actions:
        (A) Order the contractor to take affirmative action to abate
      the reprisal.
        (B) Order the contractor to reinstate the person to the
      position that the person held before the reprisal, together with
      the compensation (including back pay), employment benefits, and
      other terms and conditions of employment that would apply to the
      person in that position if the reprisal had not been taken.
        (C) Order the contractor to pay the complainant an amount equal
      to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses (including
      attorneys' fees and expert witnesses' fees) that were reasonably
      incurred by the complainant for, or in connection with, bringing
      the complaint regarding the reprisal, as determined by the head
      of the executive agency.

      (2) Whenever a person fails to comply with an order issued under
    paragraph (1), the head of the executive agency shall file an
    action for enforcement of such order in the United States district
    court for a district in which the reprisal was found to have
    occurred. In any action brought under this paragraph, the court may

    Sec. 266. Merit-based award of grants for research and development

-STATUTE-
    (a) Policy
      It is the policy of Congress that an executive agency should not
    be required by legislation to award a new grant for research,
    development, test, or evaluation to a non-Federal Government
    entity. It is further the policy of Congress that any program,
    project, or technology identified in legislation be awarded through
    merit-based selection procedures.
    (b) Rule of construction
      A provision of law may not be construed as requiring a new grant
    to be awarded to a specified non-Federal Government entity unless
    that provision of law - 
        (1) specifically refers to this subsection;
        (2) specifically identifies the particular non-Federal
      Government entity involved; and
        (3) specifically states that the award to that entity is
      required by such provision of law in contravention of the policy
      set forth in subsection (a) of this section.
    (c) New grant defined
      For purposes of this section, a grant is a new grant unless the
    work provided for in the grant is a continuation of the work
    performed by the specified entity under a preceding grant.
    (d) Inapplicability to certain grants
      This section shall not apply with respect to any grant that calls
    upon the National Academy of Sciences to investigate, examine, or
    experiment upon any subject of science or art of significance to an
    executive agency and to report on such matters to Congress or any
    agency of the Federal Government.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 266a. Share-in-savings contracts

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority to enter into share-in-savings contracts
      (1) The head of an executive agency may enter into a share-in-
    savings contract for information technology (as defined in section
    11101(6) of title 40) in which the Government awards a contract to
    improve mission-related or administrative processes or to
    accelerate the achievement of its mission and share with the
    contractor in savings achieved through contract performance.
      (2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a share-in-savings
    contract shall be awarded for a period of not more than five years.
      (B) A share-in-savings contract may be awarded for a period
    greater than five years, but not more than 10 years, if the head of
    the agency determines in writing prior to award of the contract
    that - 
        (i) the level of risk to be assumed and the investment to be
      undertaken by the contractor is likely to inhibit the government
      from obtaining the needed information technology competitively at
      a fair and reasonable price if the contract is limited in
      duration to a period of five years or less; and
        (ii) usage of the information technology to be acquired is
      likely to continue for a period of time sufficient to generate
      reasonable benefit for the government.

      (3) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section
    shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be performance-based
    contracts that identify objective outcomes and contain performance
    standards that will be used to measure achievement and milestones
    that must be met before payment is made.
      (4) Contracts awarded pursuant to the authority of this section
    shall include a provision containing a quantifiable baseline that
    is to be the basis upon which a savings share ratio is established
    that governs the amount of payment a contractor is to receive under
    the contract. Before commencement of performance of such a
    contract, the senior procurement executive of the agency shall
    determine in writing that the terms of the provision are
    quantifiable and will likely yield value to the Government.
      (5)(A) The head of the agency may retain savings realized through
    the use of a share-in-savings contract under this section that are
    in excess of the total amount of savings paid to the contractor
    under the contract, but may not retain any portion of such savings
    that is attributable to a decrease in the number of civilian
    employees of the Federal Government performing the function. Except
    as provided in subparagraph (B), savings shall be credited to the
    appropriation or fund against which charges were made to carry out
    the contract and shall be used for information technology.
      (B) Amounts retained by the agency under this subsection shall - 
        (i) without further appropriation, remain available until
      expended; and
        (ii) be applied first to fund any contingent liabilities
      associated with share-in-savings procurements that are not fully
      funded.
    (b) Cancellation and termination
      (1) If funds are not made available for the continuation of a
    share-in-savings contract entered into under this section in a
    subsequent fiscal year, the contract shall be canceled or
    terminated. The costs of cancellation or termination may be paid
    out of - 
        (A) appropriations available for the performance of the
      contract;
        (B) appropriations available for acquisition of the information
      technology procured under the contract, and not otherwise
      obligated; or
        (C) funds subsequently appropriated for payments of costs of
      cancellation or termination, subject to the limitations in
      paragraph (3).

      (2) The amount payable in the event of cancellation or
    termination of a share-in-savings contract shall be negotiated with
    the contractor at the time the contract is entered into.
      (3)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the head of an executive
    agency may enter into share-in-savings contracts under this section
    in any given fiscal year even if funds are not made specifically
    available for the full costs of cancellation or termination of the
    contract if funds are available and sufficient to make payments
    with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract and the
    following conditions are met regarding the funding of cancellation
    and termination liability:
        (i) The amount of unfunded contingent liability for the
      contract does not exceed the lesser of - 
          (I) 25 percent of the estimated costs of a cancellation or
        termination; or
          (II) $5,000,000.

        (ii) Unfunded contingent liability in excess of $1,000,000 has
      been approved by the Director of the Office of Management and
      Budget or the Director's designee.

      (B) The aggregate number of share-in-savings contracts that may
    be entered into under subparagraph (A) by all executive agencies to
    which this subchapter (!1) applies in a fiscal year may not exceed
    5 in each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005.

    (c) Definitions
      In this section:
        (1) The term "contractor" means a private entity that enters
      into a contract with an agency.
        (2) The term "savings" means - 
          (A) monetary savings to an agency; or
          (B) savings in time or other benefits realized by the agency,
        including enhanced revenues (other than enhanced revenues from
        the collection of fees, taxes, debts, claims, or other amounts
        owed the Federal Government).

        (3) The term "share-in-savings contract" means a contract under
      which - 
          (A) a contractor provides solutions for - 
            (i) improving the agency's mission-related or
          administrative processes; or
            (ii) accelerating the achievement of agency missions; and

          (B) the head of the agency pays the contractor an amount
        equal to a portion of the savings derived by the agency from - 
            (i) any improvements in mission-related or administrative
          processes that result from implementation of the solution; or
            (ii) acceleration of achievement of agency missions.
    (d) Termination

-HEAD-
    Sec. 351. Required contract provisions; minimum wages

-STATUTE-
      (a) Every contract (and any bid specification therefor) entered
    into by the United States or the District of Columbia in excess of
    $2,500, except as provided in section 356 of this title, whether
    negotiated or advertised, the principal purpose of which is to
    furnish services in the United States through the use of service
    employees, shall contain the following:
        (1) A provision specifying the minimum monetary wages to be
      paid the various classes of service employees in the performance
      of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, as determined by
      the Secretary, or his authorized representative, in accordance
      with prevailing rates for such employees in the locality, or,
      where a collective-bargaining agreement covers any such service
      employees, in accordance with the rates for such employees
      provided for in such agreement, including prospective wage
      increases provided for in such agreement as a result of arm's
      length negotiations. In no case shall such wages be lower than
      the minimum specified in subsection (b) of this section.
        (2) A provision specifying the fringe benefits to be furnished
      in the various classes of service employees, engaged in the
      performance of the contract or any subcontract thereunder, as
      determined by the Secretary or his authorized representative to
      be prevailing for such employees in the locality, or, where a
      collective-bargaining agreement covers any such service
      employees, to be provided for in such agreement, including
      prospective fringe benefits increases provided for in such
      agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations. Such fringe
      benefits shall include medical or hospital care, pensions on
      retirement or death, compensation for injuries or illness
      resulting from occupational activity, or insurance to provide any
      of the foregoing, unemployment benefits, life insurance,
      disability and sickness insurance, accident insurance, vacation
      and holiday pay, costs of apprenticeship or other similar
      programs and other bona fide fringe benefits not otherwise
      required by Federal, State, or local law to be provided by the
      contractor or subcontractor. The obligation under this
      subparagraph may be discharged by furnishing any equivalent
      combinations of fringe benefits or by making equivalent or
      differential payments in cash under rules and regulations
      established by the Secretary.
        (3) A provision that no part of the services covered by this
      chapter will be performed in buildings or surroundings or under
      working conditions, provided by or under the control or
      supervision of the contractor or any subcontractor, which are
      unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of
      service employees engaged to furnish the services.
        (4) A provision that on the date a service employee commences
      work on a contract to which this chapter applies, the contractor
      or subcontractor will deliver to the employee a notice of the
      compensation required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this
      subsection, on a form prepared by the Federal agency, or will
      post a notice of the required compensation in a prominent place
      at the worksite.
        (5) A statement of the rates that would be paid by the Federal
      agency to the various classes of service employees if section
      5341 or section 5332 of title 5 were applicable to them. The
      Secretary shall give due consideration to such rates in making
      the wage and fringe benefit determinations specified in this
      section.

      (b)(1) No contractor who enters into any contract with the
    Federal Government the principal purpose of which is to furnish
    services through the use of service employees and no subcontractor
    thereunder shall pay any of his employees engaged in performing
    work on such contracts less than the minimum wage specified under
    section 206(a)(1) of title 29.
      (2) The provisions of sections 352 to 354 of this title shall be
    applicable to violations of this subsection.

      EX. ORD. NO. 13495. NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS UNDER
                             SERVICE CONTRACTS
      Ex. Ord. No. 13495, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 6103, provided:
      When a service contract expires, and a follow-on contract is
    awarded for the same service, at the same location, the successor
    contractor or its subcontractors often hires the majority of the
    predecessor's employees. On some occasions, however, a successor
    contractor or its subcontractors hires a new work force, thus
    displacing the predecessor's employees.
      The Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and
    efficiency are served when the successor contractor hires the
    predecessor's employees. A carryover work force reduces disruption
    to the delivery of services during the period of transition between
    contractors and provides the Federal Government the benefits of an
    experienced and trained work force that is familiar with the
    Federal Government's personnel, facilities, and requirements.
      Therefore, by the authority vested in me as President by the
    Constitution and the laws of the United States of America,
    including the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, 40
    U.S.C. 101 et seq., and in order to promote economy and efficiency
    in Federal Government procurement, it is hereby ordered as follows:
      Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government
    that service contracts and solicitations for such contracts shall
    include a clause that requires the contractor, and its
    subcontractors, under a contract that succeeds a contract for
    performance of the same or similar services at the same location,
    to offer those employees (other than managerial and supervisory
    employees) employed under the predecessor contract whose employment
    will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor
    contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract
    in positions for which they are qualified. There shall be no
    employment openings under the contract until such right of first
    refusal has been provided. Nothing in this order shall be construed
    to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any
    provision of any other Executive Order or law of the United States.
      Sec. 2. Definitions.
      (a) "Service contract" or "contract" means any contract or
    subcontract for services entered into by the Federal Government or
    its contractors that is covered by the Service Contract Act of
    1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 351 et seq., and its implementing
    regulations.
      (b) "Employee" means a service employee as defined in the Service
    Contract Act of 1965, 41 U.S.C. 357(b).
      Sec. 3. Exclusions. This order shall not apply to:
      (a) contracts or subcontracts under the simplified acquisition
    threshold as defined in 41 U.S.C. 403;
      (b) contracts or subcontracts awarded pursuant to the Javits-
    Wagner-O'Day Act, 41 U.S.C. 46-48c;
      (c) guard, elevator operator, messenger, or custodial services
    provided to the Federal Government under contracts or subcontracts
    with sheltered workshops employing the severely handicapped as
    described in section 505 of the Treasury, Postal Services [sic] and
    General Government Appropriations Act, 1995, Public Law 103-329;
      (d) agreements for vending facilities entered into pursuant to
    the preference regulations issued under the Randolph-Sheppard Act,
    20 U.S.C. 107; or
      (e) employees who were hired to work under a Federal service
    contract and one or more nonfederal service contracts as part of a
    single job, provided that the employees were not deployed in a
    manner that was designed to avoid the purposes of this order.
      Sec. 4. Authority to Exempt Contracts. If the head of a
    contracting department or agency finds that the application of any
    of the requirements of this order would not serve the purposes of
    this order or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to
    procure services on an economical and efficient basis, the head of
    such department or agency may exempt its department or agency from
    the requirements of any or all of the provisions of this order with
    respect to a particular contract, subcontract, or purchase order or
    any class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders.
      Sec. 5. Contract Clause. The following contract clause shall be
    included in solicitations for and service contracts that succeed
    contracts for performance of the same or similar work at the same
    location:
      "NONDISPLACEMENT OF QUALIFIED WORKERS
      "(a) Consistent with the efficient performance of this contract,
    the contractor and its subcontractors shall, except as otherwise
    provided herein, in good faith offer those employees (other than
    managerial and supervisory employees) employed under the
    predecessor contract whose employment will be terminated as a
    result of award of this contract or the expiration of the contract
    under which the employees were hired, a right of first refusal of
    employment under this contract in positions for which employees are
    qualified. The contractor and its subcontractors shall determine
    the number of employees necessary for efficient performance of this
    contract and may elect to employ fewer employees than the
    predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of
    the work. Except as provided in paragraph (b) there shall be no
    employment opening under this contract, and the contractor and any
    subcontractors shall not offer employment under this contract, to
    any person prior to having complied fully with this obligation. The
    contractor and its subcontractors shall make an express offer of
    employment to each employee as provided herein and shall state the
    time within which the employee must accept such offer, but in no
    case shall the period within which the employee must accept the
    offer of employment be less than 10 days.
      "(b) Notwithstanding the obligation under paragraph (a) above,
    the contractor and any subcontractors (1) may employ under this
    contract any employee who has worked for the contractor or
    subcontractor for at least 3 months immediately preceding the
    commencement of this contract and who would otherwise face lay-off
    or discharge, (2) are not required to offer a right of first
    refusal to any employee(s) of the predecessor contractor who are
    not service employees within the meaning of the Service Contract
    Act of 1965, as amended, 41 U.S.C. 357(b), and (3) are not required
    to offer a right of first refusal to any employee(s) of the
    predecessor contractor whom the contractor or any of its
    subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular
    employee's past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the
    job.
      "(c) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.222-
    41(n), the contractor shall, not less than 10 days before
    completion of this contract, furnish the Contracting Officer a
    certified list of the names of all service employees working under
    this contract and its subcontracts during the last month of
    contract performance. The list shall also contain anniversary dates
    of employment of each service employee under this contract and its
    predecessor contracts either with the current or predecessor
    contractors or their subcontractors. The Contracting Officer will
    provide the list to the successor contractor, and the list shall be
    provided on request to employees or their representatives.
      "(d) If it is determined, pursuant to regulations issued by the
    Secretary of Labor (Secretary), that the contractor or its
    subcontractors are not in compliance with the requirements of this
    clause or any regulation or order of the Secretary, appropriate
    sanctions may be imposed and remedies invoked against the
    contractor or its subcontractors, as provided in Executive Order
    (No.) _____ [13495], the regulations, and relevant orders of the
    Secretary, or as otherwise provided by law.
      "(e) In every subcontract entered into in order to perform
    services under this contract, the contractor will include
    provisions that ensure that each subcontractor will honor the
    requirements of paragraphs (a) through (b) with respect to the
    employees of a predecessor subcontractor or subcontractors working
    under this contract, as well as of a predecessor contractor and its
    subcontractors. The subcontract shall also include provisions to
    ensure that the subcontractor will provide the contractor with the
    information about the employees of the subcontractor needed by the
    contractor to comply with paragraph 5(c), above. The contractor
    will take such action with respect to any such subcontract as may
    be directed by the Secretary as a means of enforcing such
    provisions, including the imposition of sanctions for non-
    compliance: provided, however, that if the contractor, as a result
    of such direction, becomes involved in litigation with a
    subcontractor, or is threatened with such involvement, the
    contractor may request that the United States enter into such
    litigation to protect the interests of the United States."
      Sec. 6. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of Labor (Secretary) is
    responsible for investigating and obtaining compliance with this
    order. In such proceedings, the Secretary shall have the authority
    to issue final orders prescribing appropriate sanctions and
    remedies, including, but not limited to, orders requiring
    employment and payment of wages lost. The Secretary also may
    provide that where a contractor or subcontractor has failed to
    comply with any order of the Secretary or has committed willful
    violations of this order or the regulations issued pursuant
    thereto, the contractor or subcontractor, and its responsible
    officers, and any firm in which the contractor or subcontractor has
    a substantial interest, shall be ineligible to be awarded any
    contract of the United States for a period of up to 3 years.
    Neither an order for debarment of any contractor or subcontractor
    from further Government contracts under this section nor the
    inclusion of a contractor or subcontractor on a published list of
    noncomplying contractors shall be carried out without affording the
    contractor or subcontractor an opportunity for a hearing.
      (b) This order creates no rights under the Contract Disputes Act
    [of 1978], and disputes regarding the requirement of the contract
    clause prescribed by section 5 of this order, to the extent
    permitted by law, shall be disposed of only as provided by the
    Secretary in regulations issued under this order. To the extent
    practicable, such regulations shall favor the resolution of
    disputes by efficient and informal alternative dispute resolution
    methods. The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Federal
    Acquisition Regulatory Council, issue regulations, within 180 days
    of the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, to
    implement the requirements of this order. The Federal Acquisition
    Regulatory Council shall issue, within 180 days of the date of this
    order, to the extent permitted by law, regulations in the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation to provide for inclusion of the contract
    clause in Federal solicitations and contracts subject to this
    order.
      Sec. 7. Revocation. Executive Order 13204 of February 17, 2001,
    is revoked.
      Sec. 8. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the
    application of such provision or amendment to any person or
    circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order
    and the application of the provisions of such to any person or
    circumstances shall not be affected thereby.
      Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be
    construed to impair or otherwise affect:
        (i) authority granted by law to an executive department,
      agency, or the head thereof; or
        (ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and
      Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative
      proposals.
      (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable
    law and subject to the availability of appropriations.
      (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right
    or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in
    equity by any party against the United States, its departments,
    agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any
    other person. This order is not intended, however, to preclude
    judicial review of final decisions by the Secretary in accordance
    with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
      Sec. 10. Effective Date. This order shall become effective
    immediately and shall apply to solicitations issued on or after the
    effective date for the action taken by the Federal Acquisition
    Regulatory Council under section 6(b) of this order.

    compensation due to any employee engaged in the performance of such
    contract. So much of the accrued payment due on the contract or any
    other contract between the same contractor and the Federal
    Government may be withheld as is necessary to pay such employees.
    Such withheld sums shall be held in a deposit fund. On order of the
    Secretary, any compensation which the head of the Federal agency or
    the Secretary has found to be due pursuant to this chapter shall be
    paid directly to the underpaid employees from any accrued payments
    withheld under this chapter.
    (b) Enforcement of section
      In accordance with regulations prescribed pursuant to section 353
    of this title, the Federal agency head or the Secretary is hereby
    authorized to carry out the provisions of this section.
    (c) Cancellation of contract; contracts for completion of original
      contract; liability of original contractor for additional cost
      In addition, when a violation is found of any contract
    stipulation, the contract is subject upon written notice to
    cancellation by the contracting agency. Whereupon, the United
    States may enter into other contracts or arrangements for the
    completion of the original contract, charging any additional cost
    to the original contractor.

    Sec. 353. Law governing authority of Secretary

-STATUTE-
    (a) Enforcement of chapter
      Sections 38 and 39 of this title shall govern the Secretary's
    authority to enforce this chapter, make rules, regulations, issue
    orders, hold hearings, and make decisions based upon findings of
    fact, and take other appropriate action hereunder.
    (b) Limitations and regulations allowing variations, tolerances,
      and exemptions
      The Secretary may provide such reasonable limitations and may
    make such rules and regulations allowing reasonable variation,
    tolerances, and exemptions to and from any or all provisions of
    this chapter (other than section 358 of this title), but only in
    special circumstances where he determines that such limitation,
    variation, tolerance, or exemption is necessary and proper in the
    public interest or to avoid the serious impairment of government
    business, and is in accord with the remedial purpose of this
    chapter to protect prevailing labor standards.
    (c) Predecessor contracts; employees' wages and fringe benefits
      No contractor or subcontractor under a contract, which succeeds a
    contract subject to this chapter and under which substantially the
    same services are furnished, shall pay any service employee under
    such contract less than the wages and fringe benefits, including
    accrued wages and fringe benefits, and any prospective increases in
    wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective-bargaining
    agreement as a result of arm's-length negotiations, to which such
    service employees would have been entitled if they were employed
    under the predecessor contract: Provided, That in any of the
    foregoing circumstances such obligations shall not apply if the
    Secretary finds after a hearing in accordance with regulations
    adopted by the Secretary that such wages and fringe benefits are
    substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of
    a character similar in the locality.
    (d) Duration of contract
      Subject to limitations in annual appropriation Acts but
    notwithstanding any other provision of law, contracts to which this
    chapter applies may, if authorized by the Secretary, be for any
    term of years not exceeding five, if each such contract provides
    for the periodic adjustment of wages and fringe benefits pursuant
    to future determinations, issued in the manner prescribed in
    section 351 of this title no less often than once every two years
    during the term of the contract, covering the various classes of
    service employees.

      appearing on list; actions to recover underpayments; payment of
      sums recovered

-STATUTE-
      (a) The Comptroller General is directed to distribute a list to
    all agencies of the Government giving the names of persons or firms
    that the Federal agencies or the Secretary have found to have
    violated this chapter. Unless the Secretary otherwise recommends
    because of unusual circumstances, no contract of the United States
    shall be awarded to the persons or firms appearing on this list or
    to any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which such
    persons or firms have a substantial interest until three years have
    elapsed from the date of publication of the list containing the
    name of such persons or firms. Where the Secretary does not
    otherwise recommend because of unusual circumstances, he shall, not
    later than ninety days after a hearing examiner has made a finding
    of a violation of this chapter, forward to the Comptroller General
    the name of the individual or firm found to have violated the
    provisions of this chapter.
      (b) If the accrued payments withheld under the terms of the
    contract are insufficient to reimburse all service employees with
    respect to whom there has been a failure to pay the compensation
    required pursuant to this chapter, the United States may bring
    action against the contractor, subcontractor, or any sureties in
    any court of competent jurisdiction to recover the remaining amount
    of underpayments. Any sums thus recovered by the United States
    shall be held in the deposit fund and shall be paid, on order of
    the Secretary, directly to the underpaid employee or employees. Any
    sum not paid to an employee because of inability to do so within
    three years shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States
    as miscellaneous receipts.

    as follows:
      Section 1. To make procurement more effective in support of
    mission accomplishment and consistent with recommendations of the
    National Performance Review, heads of executive agencies engaged in
    the procurement of supplies and services shall:
      (a) Review agency procurement rules, reporting requirements,
    contractual requirements, certification procedures, and other
    administrative procedures over and above those required by statute,

    encourage and reward innovation;
      (b) Review existing and planned agency programs to assure that

    results and on increased attention to understanding and meeting
    customer needs;
      (d) Increase the use of commercially available items where
    practicable, place more emphasis on past contractor performance,
    and promote best value rather than simply low cost in selecting
    sources for supplies and services;
      (e) Ensure that simplified acquisition procedures are used, to
    the maximum extent practicable, for procurements under the
    simplified acquisition threshold in order to reduce administrative
    burdens and more effectively support the accomplishment of agency
    missions;
      (f) Expand the use of the Government purchase card by the agency
    and take maximum advantage of the micro-purchase authority provided
    in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103-
    355, see Short Title of 1994 Amendment note set out under section
    251 of this title] by delegating the authority, to the maximum
    extent practicable, to the offices that will be using the supplies
    or services to be purchased;
      (g) Establish clear lines of contracting authority and
    accountability;
      (h) Establish career education programs for procurement
    professionals, including requirements for successful completion of
    educational requirements or mandatory training for entry level
    positions and for promotion to higher level positions, in order to
    ensure a highly qualified procurement work force;
      (i) Designate a Procurement Executive with agency-wide
    responsibility to oversee development of procurement goals,
    guidelines, and innovation, measure and evaluate procurement office
    performance against stated goals, enhance career development of the

           STREAMLINING PROCUREMENT THROUGH ELECTRONIC COMMERCE       
      Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 28, 1993, 58
    F.R. 58095, provided:
      Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
    [and] the President's Management Council
      The Federal Government spends $200 billion annually buying goods
    and services. Unfortunately, the red tape and burdensome paperwork
    of the current procurement system increases costs, produces
    unnecessary delays, and reduces Federal work force productivity.
    Moving to an electronic commerce system to simplify and streamline
    the purchasing process will promote customer service and cost-
    effectiveness. The electronic exchange of acquisition information
    between the private sector and the Federal Government also will
    increase competition by improving access to Federal contracting
    opportunities for the more than 300,000 vendors currently doing
    business with the Government, particularly small businesses, as
    well as many other vendors who find access to bidding opportunities
    difficult under the current system. For these reasons, I am
    committed to fundamentally altering and improving the way the
    Federal Government buys goods and services by ensuring that
    electronic commerce is implemented for appropriate Federal
    purchases as quickly as possible.
      1. OBJECTIVES.
      The objectives of this electronic commerce initiative are to:
      (a) exchange procurement information - such as solicitations,
    offers, contracts, purchase orders, invoices, payments, and other
    contractual documents - electronically between the private sector
    and the Federal Government to the maximum extent practical;
      (b) provide businesses, including small, small disadvantaged, and
    women-owned businesses, with greater access to Federal procurement
    opportunities;
      (c) ensure that potential suppliers are provided simplified
    access to the Federal Government's electronic commerce system;
      (d) employ nationally and internationally recognized data formats
    that serve to broaden and ease the electronic interchange of data;
    and
      (e) use agency and industry systems and networks to enable the
    Government and potential suppliers to exchange information and
    access Federal procurement data.
      2. IMPLEMENTATION.
      The President's Management Council, in coordination with the
    Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management
    and Budget, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies
    with applicable technical and functional expertise, as necessary,
    shall provide overall leadership, management oversight, and policy
    direction to implement electronic commerce in the executive branch
    through the following actions:
      (a) by March 1994, define the architecture for the Government-
    wide electronic commerce acquisition system and identify executive
    departments or agencies responsible for developing, implementing,
    operating, and maintaining the Federal electronic system;
      (b) by September 1994, establish an initial electronic commerce
    capability to enable the Federal Government and private vendors to
    electronically exchange standardized requests for quotations,
    quotes, purchase orders, and notice of awards and begin Government-
    wide implementation;
      (c) by July 1995, implement a full scale Federal electronic
    commerce system that expands initial capabilities to include
    electronic payments, document interchange, and supporting
    databases; and
      (d) by January 1997, complete Government-wide implementation of
    electronic commerce for appropriate Federal purchases, to the
    maximum extent possible.
      This implementation schedule should be accelerated where
    practicable.
      The head of each executive department or agency shall:
      (a) ensure that budgetary resources are available, within
    approved budget levels, for electronic commerce implementation in
    each respective department or agency;
      (b) assist the President's Management Council in implementing the
    electronic commerce system as quickly as possible in accordance
    with the schedules established herein; and
      (c) designate one or more senior level employees to assist the
    President's Management Council and serve as a point of contact for
    the development and implementation of the Federal electronic
    commerce system within each respective department or agency.
      3. NO PRIVATE RIGHTS CREATED.
      This directive is for the internal management of the executive
    branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or
    procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its
    agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any
    other person.
      The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized
    and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 405c. Ethics safeguards related to contractor conflicts of
      interest

-STATUTE-
    (a) Policy on personal conflicts of interest by employees of
      Federal Government contractors
      Not later than 270 days after October 14, 2008, the Administrator
    for Federal Procurement Policy shall develop and issue a standard
    policy to prevent personal conflicts of interest by contractor
    employees performing acquisition functions closely associated with
    inherently governmental functions (including the development,
    award, and administration of Government contracts) for or on behalf
    of a Federal agency or department.
      (1) Elements of policy
        The policy required under subsection (a) shall - 
          (A) provide a definition of the term "personal conflict of
        interest" as it relates to contractor employees performing
        acquisition functions closely associated with inherently
        governmental functions; and
          (B) require each contractor whose employees perform
        acquisition functions closely associated with inherently
        governmental functions to - 
            (i) identify and prevent personal conflicts of interest for
          employees of the contractor who are performing such
          functions;
            (ii) prohibit contractor employees who have access to non-
          public government information obtained while performing such
          functions from using such information for personal gain;
            (iii) report any personal conflict-of-interest violation by
          such an employee to the applicable contracting officer or
          contracting officer's representative as soon as it is
          identified;
            (iv) maintain effective oversight to verify compliance with
          personal conflict-of-interest safeguards;
            (v) have procedures in place to screen for potential
          conflicts of interest for all employees performing such
          functions; and
            (vi) take appropriate disciplinary action in the case of
          employees who fail to comply with policies established
          pursuant to this section.
      (2) Contract clause
        (A) The Administrator shall develop a personal conflicts-of-
      interest clause or a set of clauses for inclusion in
      solicitations and contracts (and task or delivery orders) for the
      performance of acquisition functions closely associated with
      inherently governmental functions that sets forth the personal
      conflicts-of-interest policy developed under this subsection and
      that sets forth the contractor's responsibilities under such
      policy.
        (B) Subparagraph (A) shall take effect 300 days after October
      14, 2008, and shall apply to - 
          (i) contracts entered into on or after that effective date;
        and
          (ii) task or delivery orders awarded on or after that
        effective date, regardless of whether the contracts pursuant to
        which such task or delivery orders are awarded are entered
        before, on, or after October 14, 2008.
      (3) Applicability
        (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), this subsection
      shall apply to any contract for an amount in excess of the
      simplified acquisition threshold (as defined in section 403(11)
      of this title) if the contract is for the performance of
      acquisition functions closely associated with inherently
      governmental functions.
        (B) If only a portion of a contract described in subparagraph
      (A) is for the performance of acquisition functions described in
      that subparagraph, then this subsection applies only to that
      portion of the contract.
    (b) Review of Federal acquisition regulation relating to conflicts
      of interest
      (1) Review
        Not later than 12 months after October 14, 2008, the
      Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, in consultation
      with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, shall
      review the Federal Acquisition Regulation to - 
          (A) identify contracting methods, types and services that
        raise heightened concerns for potential personal and
        organizational conflicts of interest; and
          (B) determine whether revisions to the Federal Acquisition
        Regulation are necessary to - 
            (i) address personal conflicts of interest by contractor
          employees with respect to functions other than those
          described in subsection (a); or
            (ii) achieve sufficiently rigorous, comprehensive, and
          uniform government-wide policies to prevent and mitigate
          organizational conflicts of interest in Federal contracting.
      (2) Regulatory revisions
        If the Administrator determines pursuant to the review under
      paragraph (1)(B) that revisions to the Federal Acquisition
      Regulation are necessary, the Administrator shall work with the
      Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to prescribe appropriate
      revisions to the regulations, including the development of
      appropriate contract clauses.
      (3) Report
        Not later than March 1, 2010, the Administrator shall submit to
      the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of
      Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and
      Governmental Affairs in the Senate, and the Committee on
      Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives a
      report setting forth such findings and determinations under
      subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1), together with an
      assessment of any revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation
      that may be necessary.
    (c) Best practices
      The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy shall, in
    consultation with the Director of the Office Government Ethics,
    develop and maintain a repository of best practices relating to the
    prevention and mitigation of organizational and personal conflicts
    of interest in Federal contracting.

      litigation or dispute) involving the Federal Government in any
      trial, hearing, or proceeding before any court, administrative
      tribunal, or agency, or in any part of an alternative dispute
      resolution process, whether or not the expert is expected to
      testify; or

      pursuant to the special procedures provided in section 393(c) of
      title 6.

    title 10.
      (3) The requirements of subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section
    shall not apply in the case of any procurement for which the head
    of the executive agency makes a determination in writing, after

    and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, that it
    is not appropriate or reasonable to publish a notice before issuing
    a solicitation.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Regulations; legitimate proprietary interest of United States
      The legitimate proprietary interest of the United States and of a
    contractor in technical or other data shall be defined in
    regulations prescribed as part of the single system of Government-
    wide procurement regulations as defined in section 403(4) (!1) of
    this title. Such regulations may not impair any right of the United
    States or of any contractor with respect to patents or copyrights
    or any other right in technical data otherwise established by law.
    Such regulations shall provide, with respect to executive agencies
    that are subject to the provisions of title III of the Federal
    Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 [41 U.S.C. 251 et
    seq.], that the United States may not require persons who have
    developed products or processes offered or to be offered for sale
    to the public as a condition for the procurement of such products
    or processes by the United States, to provide to the United States
    technical data relating to the design, development, or manufacture
    of such products or processes (except for such data as may be
    necessary for the United States to operate and maintain the product
    or use the process if obtained by the United States as an element
    of performance under the contract).

    (b) Unlimited rights; technical data; developed with Federal funds;

    Administrative Services Act of 1949 [41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.], that
    the United States shall have unlimited rights in technical data
    developed exclusively with Federal funds if delivery of such data -
    
        (A) was required as an element of performance under a contract;
      and
        (B) is needed to ensure the competitive acquisition of supplies
      or services that will be required in substantial quantities in
      the future.

      (2) Except as otherwise expressly provided by Federal statute,
    the regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) of this
    section shall provide, with respect to executive agencies that are
    subject to the provisions of title III of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 [41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.], that
    the United States (and each agency thereof) shall have an
    unrestricted, royalty-free right to use, or to have its contractors
    use, for governmental purposes (excluding publication outside the
    Government) technical data developed exclusively with Federal
    funds.
      (3) The requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be in
    addition to and not in lieu of any other rights that the United

      pertains was developed - 
          (A) exclusively with Federal funds;
          (B) exclusively at private expense; or
          (C) in part with Federal funds and in part at private
        expense.

        (2) The statement of congressional policy and objectives in
      section 200 of title 35, the statement of purposes in section
      2(b) of the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982
      (Public Law 97-219; 15 U.S.C. 638 note), and the declaration of
      policy in section 631 of title 15.
        (3) The interest of the United States in increasing competition
      and lowering costs by developing and locating alternative sources
      of supply and manufacture.
    (d) Provisions; contracts; regulations
      Regulations prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall
    require that a contract for property or services entered into by an
    executive agency contain appropriate provisions relating to
    technical data, including provisions - 
        (1) defining the respective rights of the United States and the
      contractor or subcontractor (at any tier) regarding any technical

      delivered under the contract to reflect engineering design
      changes made during the performance of the contract and affecting
      the form, fit, and function of the items specified in the
      contract and to deliver such revised technical data to an agency
      within a time specified in the contract;
        (7) requiring the contractor to furnish written assurance at
      the time the technical data is delivered or is made available
      that the technical data is complete and accurate and satisfies
      the requirements of the contract concerning technical data;
        (8) establishing remedies to be available to the United States
      when technical data required to be delivered or made available
      under the contract is found to be incomplete or inadequate or to
      not satisfy the requirements of the contract concerning technical
      data; and
        (9) authorizing the head of the agency to withhold payments
      under the contract (or exercise such other remedies as the head
      of the agency considers appropriate) during any period if the
      contractor does not meet the requirements of the contract
      pertaining to the delivery of technical data.

    (a) Establishment

    (hereinafter in this section referred to as the "Council") to
    assist in the direction and coordination of Government-wide
    procurement policy and Government-wide procurement regulatory
    activities in the Federal Government.
    (b) Membership
      (1) The Council shall consist of the Administrator for Federal
    Procurement Policy and - 
        (A) the Secretary of Defense,
        (B) the Administrator of National Aeronautics and Space; and
        (C) the Administrator of General Services.

      (2) Notwithstanding section 121(d)(1) and (2) of title 40, the
    officials specified in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph
    (1) may designate to serve on and attend meetings of the Council in
    place of that official (A) the official assigned by statute with
    the responsibility for acquisition policy in each of their
    respective agencies or, in the case of the Secretary of Defense, an
    official at an organizational level not lower than an Assistant
    Secretary of Defense within the Office of the Under Secretary of
    Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; or (B) if no
    official of such agency is assigned by statute with the
    responsibility for acquisition policy for that agency, the official
    designated pursuant to section 414(3) (!1) of this title. No other
    official or employee may be designated to serve on the Council.

    (c) Functions
      (1) Subject to the provisions of section 405 of this title, the
    General Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration, pursuant to their
    respective authorities under title III of the Federal Property and
    Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251, et seq.),
    chapters 4 and 137 of title 10, and the National Aeronautics and
    Space Act of 1958 (42 U.S.C. 2451, et seq.), shall jointly issue
    and maintain in accordance with subsection (f) of this section a
    single Government-wide procurement regulation, to be known as the
    "Federal Acquisition Regulation".
      (2) Any other regulations relating to procurement issued by an
    executive agency shall be limited to (A) regulations essential to
    implement Government-wide policies and procedures within the
    agency, and (B) additional policies and procedures required to
    satisfy the specific and unique needs of the agency.
      (3) The Administrator, in consultation with the Council, shall
    ensure that procurement regulations promulgated by executive
    agencies are consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation and
    in accordance with any policies issued pursuant to section 405(a)
    of this title.
      (4)(A) Under procedures established by the Administrator, a
    person may request the Administrator to review any regulation
    relating to procurement on the basis that such regulation is
    inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
      (B) Unless the request is frivolous or does not, on its face,
    state a valid basis for such review, the Administrator shall
    complete such a review not later than 60 days after receiving the
    request. The time for completion of the review may be extended if
    the Administrator determines that an additional period of review is
    required. The Administrator shall advise the requester of the
    reasons for the extension and the date by which the review will be
    completed.
      (5) If the Administrator determines that a regulation relating to
    procurement is inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation
    or that the regulation should otherwise be revised to remove an
    inconsistency with any policies issued under section 405(a) of this
    title, the Administrator shall rescind or deny the promulgation of
    the regulation or take such other action authorized under section
    405 of this title as may be necessary to remove the inconsistency.
    If the Administrator determines that such a regulation, although
    not inconsistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulation or such
    policies, should be revised to improve compliance with such
    Regulation or policies, the Administrator shall take such action
    authorized under section 405 of this title as may be necessary and
    appropriate.
      (6) The decisions of the Administrator shall be in writing and
    made publicly available. The Administrator shall provide a listing
    of such decisions in the annual report to Congress required by
    section 407 (!1) of this title.
    (d) Additional responsibilities of membership
      Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the head of
    the agency concerned, each official who represents an agency on the
    Council pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall - 
        (1) approve or disapprove all regulations that are, after 60
      days after November 17, 1988, proposed for public comment,
      promulgated in final form, or otherwise made effective by such
      agency relating to procurement before such regulation may be
      promulgated in final form, or otherwise made effective, except
      that such official may grant an interim approval, without review,
      for not more than 60 days for a procurement regulation in urgent
      and compelling circumstances;
        (2) carry out the responsibilities of such agency set forth in
      chapter 35 of title 44 for each information collection request
      (as that term is defined in section 3502(11) (!1) of title 44)
      that relates to procurement rules or regulations; and
        (3) eliminate or reduce (A) any redundant or unnecessary levels
      of review and approval, in the procurement system of such agency,
      and (B) redundant or unnecessary procurement regulations which
      are unique to that agency.

    The authority to review and approve or disapprove regulations under
    paragraph (1) of this subsection may not be delegated to any person
    outside the office of the official who represents the agency on the
    Council pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.

      Subject to section 405(b) of this title, the Council shall
    manage, coordinate, control, and monitor the maintenance of, and
    issuance of and changes in, the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

    competitive service, and may pay such employees without regard to
    the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of
    such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay
    rates, except that no individual so appointed may receive pay in

    General Schedule.
    (c) Other staff
      The Administrator may appoint, fix the compensation, and remove

    Federal agency (with the consent of the head of the agency
    concerned) to serve on advisory committees and task forces to
    assist the Board in carrying out the functions and responsibilities
    of the Board under this section.
      (2) The Administrator, after consultation with the Board, may
    procure temporary and intermittent services under section 3109(b)

    section, shall receive no additional compensation for services, but
    shall continue to be compensated by the employing Department or
    agency of such officer or employee. Each member of the Board

    homes or the regular place of business, Board members and other
    appointees serving on an intermittent basis under this section
    shall be allowed travel expenses in accordance with section 5703 of

    (f) Cost accounting standards authority
      (1) The Board shall have the exclusive authority to make,
    promulgate, amend, and rescind cost accounting standards and
    interpretations thereof designed to achieve uniformity and
    consistency in the cost accounting standards governing measurement,
    assignment, and allocation of costs to contracts with the United
    States.
      (2)(A) Cost accounting standards promulgated under this section
    shall be mandatory for use by all executive agencies and by
    contractors and subcontractors in estimating, accumulating, and
    reporting costs in connection with pricing and administration of,
    and settlement of disputes concerning, all negotiated prime
    contract and subcontract procurements with the United States in
    excess of the amount set forth in section 2306a(a)(1)(A)(i) of
    title 10, as such amount is adjusted in accordance with applicable
    requirements of law.
      (B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the following contracts or
    subcontracts:
        (i) Contracts or subcontracts for the acquisition of commercial

      certified cost or pricing data.
        (iv) A contract or subcontract with a value of less than
      $7,500,000 if, at the time the contract or subcontract is entered
      into, the segment of the contractor or subcontractor that will
      perform the work has not been awarded at least one contract or
      subcontract with a value of more than $7,500,000 that is covered
      by the cost accounting standards.

      (C) In this paragraph, the term "subcontract" includes a transfer
    of commercial items between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates
    of a contractor or subcontractor.
      (3) The Administrator, after consultation with the Board, shall
    prescribe rules and procedures governing actions of the Board under
    this section. Such rules and procedures shall require that any cost
    accounting standard promulgated, amended, or rescinded (and
    interpretations thereof) shall be adopted by majority vote of the
    Board members.
      (4) The Board is authorized - 
        (A) to exempt classes or categories of contractors and
      subcontractors from the requirements of this section; and
        (B) to establish procedures for the waiver of the requirements
      of this section with respect to individual contracts and
      subcontracts.

      (5)(A) The head of an executive agency may waive the
    applicability of the cost accounting standards for a contract or
    subcontract with a value less than $15,000,000 if that official
    determines in writing that the segment of the contractor or
    subcontractor that will perform the work - 
        (i) is primarily engaged in the sale of commercial items; and
        (ii) would not otherwise be subject to the cost accounting
      standards under this section, as in effect on or after the
      effective date of this paragraph.

      (B) The head of an executive agency may also waive the
    applicability of the cost accounting standards for a contract or
    subcontract under exceptional circumstances when necessary to meet
    the needs of the agency. A determination to waive the applicability
    of the cost accounting standards under this subparagraph shall be
    set forth in writing and shall include a statement of the
    circumstances justifying the waiver.
      (C) The head of an executive agency may not delegate the
    authority under subparagraph (A) or (B) to any official in the
    executive agency below the senior policymaking level in the
    executive agency.
      (D) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall include the
    following:
        (i) Criteria for selecting an official to be delegated
      authority to grant waivers under subparagraph (A) or (B).
        (ii) The specific circumstances under which such a waiver may
      be granted.

      (E) The head of each executive agency shall report the waivers
    granted under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for that agency to the
    Board on an annual basis.
    (g) Requirements for standards
      (1) Prior to the promulgation under this section of cost
    accounting standards and interpretations thereof, the Board shall -
    
        (A) take into account, after consultation and discussions with
      the Comptroller General and professional accounting
      organizations, contractors, and other interested parties - 
          (i) the probable costs of implementation, including
        inflationary effects, if any, compared to the probable
        benefits;
          (ii) the advantages, disadvantages, and improvements
        anticipated in the pricing and administration of, and
        settlement of disputes concerning, contracts; and
          (iii) the scope of, and alternatives available to, the action
        proposed to be taken;

        (B) prepare and publish a report in the Federal Register on the
      issues reviewed under paragraph (1)(A);
        (C)(i) publish an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in the
      Federal Register in order to solicit comments on the report
      prepared pursuant to subparagraph (B);
        (ii) provide all parties affected a period of not less than 60
      days after such publication to submit their views and comments;
      and
        (iii) during this 60-day period, consult with the Comptroller
      General and consider any recommendation the Comptroller General
      may make; and
        (D) publish a notice of such proposed rulemaking in the Federal
      Register and provide all parties affected a period of not less
      than 60 days after such publication to submit their views and
      comments.

      (2) Rules, regulations, cost accounting standards, and
    modifications thereof promulgated or amended under this section
    shall have the full force and effect of law, and shall become
    effective within 120 days after publication in the Federal Register
    in final form, unless the Board determines a longer period is
    necessary. Implementation dates for contractors and subcontractors
    shall be determined by the Board, but in no event shall such dates
    be later than the beginning of the second fiscal year of the
    contractor or subcontractor after the standard becomes effective.
    Rules, regulations, cost accounting standards, and modifications
    thereof promulgated or amended under this section shall be
    accompanied by prefatory comments and by illustrations, if
    necessary.
      (3) The functions exercised under this section are excluded from
    the operation of sections 551, 553 through 559, and 701 through 706
    of title 5.
    (h) Implementing regulations
      (1) The Board shall promulgate rules and regulations for the
    implementation of cost accounting standards promulgated or
    interpreted under subsection (f) of this section. Such regulations
    shall be incorporated into the Federal Acquisition Regulation and
    shall require contractors and subcontractors as a condition of
    contracting with the United States to - 
        (A) disclose in writing their cost accounting practices,
      including methods of distinguishing direct costs from indirect
      costs and the basis used for allocating indirect costs; and
        (B) agree to a contract price adjustment, with interest, for
      any increased costs paid to such contractor or subcontractor by
      the United States by reason of a change in the contractor's or
      subcontractor's cost accounting practices or by reason of a
      failure by the contractor or subcontractor to comply with
      applicable cost accounting standards.

      (2) If the United States and a contractor or subcontractor fail
    to agree on a contract price adjustment, including whether the
    contractor or subcontractor has complied with the applicable cost
    accounting standards, the disagreement will constitute a dispute
    under the Contract Disputes Act [41 U.S.C. 601 et seq.].
      (3) Any contract price adjustment undertaken pursuant to
    paragraph (1)(B) shall be made, where applicable, on relevant
    contracts between the United States and the contractor that are
    subject to the cost accounting standards so as to protect the
    United States from payment, in the aggregate, of increased costs
    (as defined by the Board). In no case shall the Government recover
    costs greater than the increased cost (as defined by the Board) to
    the Government, in the aggregate, on the relevant contracts subject
    to the price adjustment, unless the contractor made a change in its
    cost accounting practices of which it was aware or should have been
    aware at the time of the price negotiation and which it failed to
    disclose to the Government.
      (4) The interest rate applicable to any contract price adjustment
    shall be the annual rate of interest established under section 6621
    of title 26 for such period. Such interest shall accrue from the
    time payments of the increased costs were made to the contractor or
    subcontractor to the time the United States receives full
    compensation for the price adjustment.
    (i) Omitted
    (j) Effect on other standards and regulations
      (1) All cost accounting standards, waivers, exemptions,
    interpretations, modifications, rules, and regulations promulgated
    by the Cost Accounting Standards Board under section 2168 (!1) of
    title 50, Appendix, shall remain in effect unless and until
    amended, superseded, or rescinded by the Board pursuant to this
    section.

      (2) Existing cost accounting standards referred to in paragraph
    (1) shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter in the same
    manner as if promulgated by the Board under this chapter.
      (3) The Administrator, under the authority set forth in section
    405 of this title, shall ensure that no regulation or proposed
    regulation of an executive agency is inconsistent with a cost
    accounting standard promulgated or amended under this section by
    rescinding or denying the promulgation of any such inconsistent
    regulation or proposed regulation and taking such other action
    authorized under section 405 of this title as may be appropriate.
      (4) Costs which are the subject of cost accounting standards
    promulgated under this section shall not be subject to regulations
    that are established by another executive agency that differ from
    such standards with respect to the measurement, assignment, and
    allocation of such costs.
    (k) Examinations
      For the purpose of determining whether a contractor or
    subcontractor has complied with cost accounting standards
    promulgated under this section and has followed consistently the
    contractor's or subcontractor's disclosed cost accounting
    practices, any authorized representative of the head of the agency
    concerned, of the offices of inspector general established pursuant
    to the Inspector General Act of 1978, or of the Comptroller General
    of the United States shall have the right to examine and make
    copies of any documents, papers, or records of such contractor or
    subcontractor relating to compliance with such cost accounting
    standards.
    (l) Authorization of appropriations
      There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be
    necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

    (c) Actions required of procurement officers when contacted by

        (A) promptly report the contact in writing to the official's
      supervisor and to the designated agency ethics official (or

        (B)(i) reject the possibility of non-Federal employment; or
        (ii) disqualify himself or herself from further personal and
      substantial participation in that Federal agency procurement
      until such time as the agency has authorized the official to
      resume participation in such procurement, in accordance with the
      requirements of section 208 of title 18 and applicable agency
      regulations on the grounds that - 
          (I) the person is no longer a bidder or offeror in that
        Federal agency procurement; or
          (II) all discussions with the bidder or offeror regarding
        possible non-Federal employment have terminated without an
        agreement or arrangement for employment.

      (2) Each report required by this subsection shall be retained by
    the agency for not less than two years following the submission of

    the disclosure requirements of section 552 of title 5 under
    subsection (b)(1) of such section may be withheld from disclosure
    to the public.
      (3) An official who knowingly fails to comply with the

      contracting officer, the source selection authority, a member of
      the source selection evaluation board, or the chief of a
      financial or technical evaluation team in a procurement in which
      that contractor was selected for award of a contract in excess of
      $10,000,000;

          (i) a decision to award a contract, subcontract, modification
        of a contract or subcontract, or a task order or delivery order
        in excess of $10,000,000 to that contractor;

    from any division or affiliate of a contractor that does not
    produce the same or similar products or services as the entity of
    the contractor that is responsible for the contract referred to in
    subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of such paragraph.

    official regarding whether the official or former official is or
    would be precluded by this subsection from accepting compensation
    from a particular contractor.

    Sec. 427. Simplified acquisition procedures

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirement
      In order to promote efficiency and economy in contracting and to
    avoid unnecessary burdens for agencies and contractors, the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation shall provide for - 
        (1) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and
      services for amounts not greater than the simplified acquisition
      threshold; and
        (2) special simplified procedures for purchases of property and
      services for amounts greater than the simplified acquisition
      threshold but not greater than $5,000,000 with respect to which
      the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature
      of the property or services sought and on market research, that
      offers will include only commercial items.
    (b) Prohibition on dividing purchases
      A proposed purchase or contract for an amount above the
    simplified acquisition threshold may not be divided into several
    purchases or contracts for lesser amounts in order to use the
    simplified acquisition procedures required by subsection (a) of
    this section.
    (c) Promotion of competition required
      In using simplified acquisition procedures, the head of an
    executive agency shall promote competition to the maximum extent
    practicable.
    (d) Consideration of offers timely received
      The simplified acquisition procedures contained in the Federal
    Acquisition Regulation shall include a requirement that a
    contracting officer consider each responsive offer timely received
    from an eligible offeror.
    (e) Interim reporting rule
      Until October 1, 2004, procuring activities shall continue to
    report under section 417(d) of this title procurement awards with a
    dollar value of at least $25,000, but less than $100,000, in
    conformity with the procedures for the reporting of a contract
    award greater than $25,000 that were in effect on October 1, 1992.
    (f) Special rules for commercial items
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide that, in the
    case of a purchase of commercial items using special simplified
    procedures, an executive agency - 
        (1) shall publish a notice in accordance with section 416 of
      this title and, as provided in subsection (b)(4) of such section,
      permit all responsible sources to submit a bid, proposal, or
      quotation (as appropriate) which shall be considered by the
      agency;
        (2) may not conduct the purchase on a sole source basis unless
      the need to do so is justified in writing and approved in
      accordance with section 2304 of title 10 or section 253 of this
      title, as applicable; and
        (3) shall include in the contract file a written description of
      the procedures used in awarding the contract and the number of
      offers received.

    provisions of law that are inapplicable to contracts for the
    procurement of commercial items. A provision of law that is

      (2) A provision of law described in subsection (c) of this

    may not be construed as applicable to such subcontracts. Nothing in
    this section shall be construed to render inapplicable to
    subcontracts under a contract for the procurement of commercial
    items any provision of law that is not included on such list.
      (2) A provision of law described in subsection (c) of this
    section shall be included on the list of inapplicable provisions of
    law required by paragraph (1) unless the Federal Acquisition
    Regulatory Council makes a written determination that it would not
    be in the best interest of the Federal Government to exempt
    subcontracts under a contract for the procurement of commercial
    items from the applicability of the provision.

    the waiver of the applicability of any provision of law with
    respect to any subcontract under a contract with a prime contractor
    reselling or distributing commercial items of another contractor
    without adding value.
      (4) In this subsection, the term "subcontract" includes a
    transfer of commercial items between divisions, subsidiaries, or
    affiliates of a contractor or subcontractor.
    (c) Covered law

    procedures, requirements, or restrictions for the procurement of
    property or services by the Federal Government, except for a
    provision of law that - 
        (1) provides for criminal or civil penalties; or

      notwithstanding this section, it shall be applicable to contracts
      for the procurement of commercial items.

    Sec. 431a. Inflation adjustment of acquisition-related dollar
      thresholds

-STATUTE-
    (a) Requirement for periodic adjustment
      (1) On October 1 of each year that is evenly divisible by five,
    the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall adjust each
    acquisition-related dollar threshold provided by law, as described
    in subsection (c) of this section, to the baseline constant dollar
    value of that threshold.
      (2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), the baseline constant
    dollar value - 
        (A) for a dollar threshold in effect on October 1, 2000, that
      was first specified in a law that took effect on or before such
      date shall be the October 1, 2000, constant dollar value of that
      dollar threshold; and
        (B) for a dollar threshold specified in a law that takes effect
      after October 1, 2000, shall be the constant dollar value of that
      threshold as of the effective date of that dollar threshold
      pursuant to such law.
    (b) Adjustments effective upon publication
      The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall publish a notice
    of the adjusted dollar thresholds under this section in the Federal
    Register. The adjusted dollar thresholds shall take effect on the
    date of publication.
    (c) Acquisition-related dollar thresholds
      Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the
    requirement for adjustment under subsection (a) of this section
    applies to a dollar threshold that is specified in law as a factor
    in defining the scope of the applicability of a policy, procedure,
    requirement, or restriction provided in that law to the procurement
    of property or services by an executive agency, as determined by
    the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council.
    (d) Excluded thresholds
      Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to - 
        (1) dollar thresholds in sections 3141 through 3144, 3146, and

      Representative pursuant to title III of the Trade Agreements Act
      of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2511 et seq.).
    (e) Calculation of adjustments
      An adjustment under this section shall - 
        (1) be calculated on the basis of changes in the Consumer Price
      Index for all-urban consumers published monthly by the Department
      of Labor; and
        (2) be rounded - 
          (A) in the case of a dollar threshold that (as in effect on
        the day before the adjustment) is less than $10,000, to the
        nearest $500;
          (B) in the case of a dollar threshold that (as in effect on
        the day before the adjustment) is not less than $10,000, but is
        less than $100,000, to the nearest $5,000;
          (C) in the case of a dollar threshold that (as in effect on
        the day before the adjustment) is not less than $100,000, but
        is less than $1,000,000, to the nearest $50,000; and
          (D) in the case of a dollar threshold that (as in effect on
        the day before the adjustment) is $1,000,000 or more, to the
        nearest $500,000.
    (f) Petition for inclusion of omitted threshold
      (1) If a dollar threshold adjustable under this section is not
    included in a notice of adjustment published under subsection (b)
    of this section, any person may request adjustment of that dollar
    threshold by submitting a petition for adjustment to the
    Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy.
      (2) Upon receipt of a petition for adjustment of a dollar

    Sec. 433. Acquisition workforce

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applicability
      Except as provided in subsection (h)(3) of this section, this
    section does not apply to an executive agency that is subject to
    chapter 87 of title 10.
    (b) Management policies
      (1) Policies and procedures
        The head of each executive agency, after consultation with the
      Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, shall establish
      policies and procedures for the effective management (including
      accession, education, training, career development, and
      performance incentives) of the acquisition workforce of the
      agency. The development of acquisition workforce policies under
      this section shall be carried out consistent with the merit
      system principles set forth in section 2301(b) of title 5.
      (2) Uniform implementation
        The head of each executive agency shall ensure that, to the
      maximum extent practicable, acquisition workforce policies and
      procedures established are uniform in their implementation
      throughout the agency.
      (3) Government-wide policies and evaluation
        The Administrator shall issue policies to promote uniform
      implementation of this section by executive agencies, with due
      regard for differences in program requirements among agencies
      that may be appropriate and warranted in view of the agency
      mission. The Administrator shall coordinate with the Deputy
      Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget to
      ensure that such policies are consistent with the policies and
      procedures established and enhanced system of incentives provided
      pursuant to section 5051(c) of the Federal Acquisition
      Streamlining Act of 1994 (41 U.S.C. 263 note). The Administrator
      shall evaluate the implementation of the provisions of this
      section by executive agencies.
    (c) Senior procurement executive authorities and responsibilities
      Subject to the authority, direction, and control of the head of
    an executive agency, the senior procurement executive of the agency
    shall carry out all powers, functions, and duties of the head of
    the agency with respect to implementation of this section. The
    senior procurement executive shall ensure that the policies of the
    head of the executive agency established in accordance with this
    section are implemented throughout the agency.
    (d) Management information systems
      The Administrator shall ensure that the heads of executive
    agencies collect and maintain standardized information on the
    acquisition workforce related to implementation of this section. To
    the maximum extent practicable, such data requirements shall
    conform to standards established by the Office of Personnel
    Management for the Central Personnel Data File.
    (e) Applicability to acquisition workforce
      The programs established by this section shall apply to the
    acquisition workforce of each executive agency. For purposes of
    this section, the acquisition workforce of an agency consists of
    all employees serving in acquisition positions listed in subsection
    (g)(1)(A) of this section.
    (f) Career development
      (1) Career paths
        The head of each executive agency shall ensure that appropriate
      career paths for personnel who desire to pursue careers in
      acquisition are identified in terms of the education, training,
      experience, and assignments necessary for career progression to
      the most senior acquisition positions. The head of each executive
      agency shall make information available on such career paths.
      (2) Critical duties and tasks
        For each career path, the head of each executive agency shall
      identify the critical acquisition-related duties and tasks in
      which, at minimum, employees of the agency in the career path
      shall be competent to perform at full performance grade levels.
      For this purpose, the head of the executive agency shall provide
      appropriate coverage of the critical duties and tasks identified
      by the Director of the Federal Acquisition Institute.
      (3) Mandatory training and education
        For each career path, the head of each executive agency shall
      establish requirements for the completion of course work and
      related on-the-job training in the critical acquisition-related
      duties and tasks of the career path. The head of each executive
      agency shall also encourage employees to maintain the currency of
      their acquisition knowledge and generally enhance their knowledge
      of related acquisition management disciplines through academic
      programs and other self-developmental activities.
      (4) Performance incentives
        The head of each executive agency shall provide for an enhanced
      system of incentives for the encouragement of excellence in the
      acquisition workforce which rewards performance of employees that
      contribute to achieving the agency's performance goals. The
      system of incentives shall include provisions that - 
          (A) relate pay to performance (including the extent to which
        the performance of personnel in such workforce contributes to
        achieving the cost goals, schedule goals, and performance goals
        established for acquisition programs pursuant to section 263(b)
        of this title); and
          (B) provide for consideration, in personnel evaluations and
        promotion decisions, of the extent to which the performance of
        personnel in such workforce contributes to achieving such cost
        goals, schedule goals, and performance goals.
    (g) Qualification requirements
      (1) In general
        (A) Subject to paragraph (2), the Administrator shall establish
      qualification requirements, including education requirements, for

          (iv) Positions in other General Schedule series in which
        significant acquisition-related functions are performed.

        (B) Subject to paragraph (2), the Administrator shall prescribe
      the manner and extent to which such qualification requirements
      shall apply to any person serving in a position described in
      subparagraph (A) at the time such requirements are established.
      (2) Relationship to requirements applicable to defense
        acquisition workforce
        The Administrator shall establish qualification requirements
      and make prescriptions under paragraph (1) that are comparable to
      those established for the same or equivalent positions pursuant
      to chapter 87 of title 10 with appropriate modifications.
      (3) Approval of requirements
        The Administrator shall submit any requirement established or
      prescription made under paragraph (1) to the Director of the
      Office of Personnel Management for approval. If the Director does
      not disapprove a requirement or prescription within 30 days after
      the date on which the Director receives it, the requirement or
      prescription is deemed to be approved by the Director.
    (h) Education and training
      (1) Funding levels
        (A) The head of an executive agency shall set forth separately
      the funding levels requested for education and training of the

      Congress under section 1105 of title 31.
        (B) Funds appropriated for education and training under this
      section may not be obligated for any other purpose.
      (2) Tuition assistance
        The head of an executive agency may provide tuition
      reimbursement in education (including a full-time course of study
      leading to a degree) in accordance with section 4107 of title 5
      for personnel serving in acquisition positions in the agency.
      (3) Acquisition workforce training fund
        (A) The Administrator of General Services shall establish an
      acquisition workforce training fund. The Administrator shall
      manage the fund through the Federal Acquisition Institute to
      support the training of the acquisition workforce of the
      executive agencies, except as provided in subparagraph (D). The
      Administrator shall consult with the Administrator for Federal
      Procurement Policy in managing the fund.
        (B) There shall be credited to the acquisition workforce
      training fund 5 percent of the fees collected by executive
      agencies (other than the Department of Defense) under the

        authorized by section 11314 of such title.
          (iii) Multiple-award schedule contracts entered into by the
        Administrator of General Services.

        (C) The head of an executive agency that administers a contract
      described in subparagraph (B) shall remit to the General Services
      Administration the amount required to be credited to the fund
      with respect to such contract at the end of each quarter of the
      fiscal year.
        (D) The Administrator of General Services shall transfer to the
      Secretary of Defense fees collected from the Department of
      Defense pursuant to subparagraph (B), to be used by the Defense
      Acquisition University for purposes of acquisition workforce
      training.
        (E) The Administrator of General Services, through the Office
      of Federal Acquisition Policy, shall ensure that funds collected
      for training under this section are not used for any purpose
      other than the purpose specified in subparagraph (A).
        (F) Amounts credited to the fund shall be in addition to funds
      requested and appropriated for education and training referred to
      in paragraph (1).

      (as described in subsection (g)(1)(A)) an individual receiving an
      annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, on
      the basis of such individual's service, without discontinuing
      such annuity. The head of each executive agency shall keep the
      Administrator informed of the agency's use of this authority.
      (2) Service not subject to CSRS or FERS
        An individual so reemployed shall not be considered an employee
      for the purposes of chapter 83 or 84 of title 5.
      (3) Criteria for exercise of authority
        Polices (!1) and procedures established pursuant to this
      subsection shall authorize the head of the executive agency, on a

        Retirement and Disability Fund on the basis of such

    122 Stat. 4553, provided that:
      "(a) Purpose. - The purpose of this section is to authorize the
    preparation and completion of a plan (to be known as the
    'Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic Plan') for Federal
    agencies other than the Department of Defense to develop a specific
    and actionable 5-year plan to increase the size of the acquisition
    workforce, and to operate a government-wide acquisition intern
    program, for such Federal agencies.
      "(b) Establishment of Plan. - The Associate Administrator for
    Acquisition Workforce Programs designated under section 855(a) of
    the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public
    Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 251; 41 U.S.C. 433(a) [433a(a)]) shall be
    responsible for the management, oversight, and administration of
    the Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic Plan in cooperation
    and consultation with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and
    the assistance of the Federal Acquisition Institute.
      "(c) Criteria. - The Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic
    Plan shall include, at a minimum, an examination of the following
    matters:
        "(1) The variety and complexity of acquisitions conducted by
      each Federal agency covered by the plan, and the workforce needed
      to effectively carry out such acquisitions.
        "(2) The development of a sustainable funding model to support
      efforts to hire, retain, and train an acquisition workforce of
      appropriate size and skill to effectively carry out the
      acquisition programs of the Federal agencies covered by the plan,
      including an examination of interagency funding methods and a
      discussion of how the model of the Defense Acquisition Workforce
      Development Fund could be applied to civilian agencies.
        "(3) Any strategic human capital planning necessary to hire,
      retain, and train an acquisition workforce of appropriate size
      and skill at each Federal agency covered by the plan.
        "(4) Methodologies that Federal agencies covered by the plan
      can use to project future acquisition workforce personnel hiring
      requirements, including an appropriate distribution of such
      personnel across each category of positions designated as
      acquisition workforce personnel under section 37(j) [probably
      should be 37(g)] of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act
      (41 U.S.C. 433(j) [433(g)]).

      opportunities of the Federal acquisition workforce within the
      Federal agencies covered by the plan.
        "(6) If the Associate Administrator recommends as part of the
      plan a growth in the acquisition workforce of the Federal
      agencies covered by the plan below 25 percent over the next 5
      years, an examination of each of the matters specified in
      paragraphs (1) through (5) in the context of a 5-year plan that
      increases the size of such acquisition workforce by not less than
      25 percent, or an explanation why such a level of growth would
      not be in the best interest of the Federal Government.
      "(d) Deadline for Completion. - The Acquisition Workforce
    Development Strategic Plan shall be completed not later than one
    year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 14, 2008]
    and in a fashion that allows for immediate implementation of its
    recommendations and guidelines.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 434. Modular contracting for information technology

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      The head of an executive agency should, to the maximum extent
    practicable, use modular contracting for an acquisition of a major
    system of information technology.
    (b) Modular contracting described
      Under modular contracting, an executive agency's need for a
    system is satisfied in successive acquisitions of interoperable
    increments. Each increment complies with common or commercially
    accepted standards applicable to information technology so that the
    increments are compatible with other increments of information
    technology comprising the system.
    (c) Implementation
      The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall provide that - 
        (1) under the modular contracting process, an acquisition of a
      major system of information technology may be divided into
      several smaller acquisition increments that - 
          (A) are easier to manage individually than would be one
        comprehensive acquisition;
          (B) address complex information technology objectives
        incrementally in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving
        workable solutions for attainment of those objectives;
          (C) provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of
        workable systems or solutions in discrete increments each of
        which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on
        any subsequent increment in order to perform its principal
        functions; and
          (D) provide an opportunity for subsequent increments of the
        acquisition to take advantage of any evolution in technology or
        needs that occur during conduct of the earlier increments;

        (2) a contract for an increment of an information technology
      acquisition should, to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded
      within 180 days after the date on which the solicitation is
      issued and, if the contract for that increment cannot be awarded
      within such period, the increment should be considered for
      cancellation; and
        (3) the information technology provided for in a contract for
      acquisition of information technology should be delivered within
      18 months after the date on which the solicitation resulting in
      award of the contract was issued.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 439. Public-private competition required before conversion to
      contractor performance

-STATUTE-
    (a) Public-private competition
      (1) A function of an executive agency performed by 10 or more
    agency civilian employees may not be converted, in whole or in
    part, to performance by a contractor unless the conversion is based
    on the results of a public-private competition that - 
        (A) formally compares the cost of performance of the function
      by agency civilian employees with the cost of performance by a
      contractor;
        (B) creates an agency tender, including a most efficient
      organization plan, in accordance with Office of Management and
      Budget Circular A-76, as implemented on May 29, 2003, or any
      successor circular;
        (C) includes the issuance of a solicitation;
        (D) determines whether the submitted offers meet the needs of
      the executive agency with respect to factors other than cost,
      including quality, reliability, and timeliness;
        (E) examines the cost of performance of the function by agency
      civilian employees and the cost of performance of the function by
      one or more contractors to demonstrate whether converting to
      performance by a contractor will result in savings to the
      Government over the life of the contract, including - 
          (i) the estimated cost to the Government (based on offers
        received) for performance of the function by a contractor;
          (ii) the estimated cost to the Government for performance of
        the function by agency civilian employees; and
          (iii) an estimate of all other costs and expenditures that
        the Government would incur because of the award of such a
        contract;

        (F) requires continued performance of the function by agency
      civilian employees unless the difference in the cost of
      performance of the function by a contractor compared to the cost
      of performance of the function by agency civilian employees
      would, over all performance periods required by the solicitation,
      be equal to or exceed the lesser of - 
          (i) 10 percent of the personnel-related costs for performance
        of that function in the agency tender; or
          (ii) $10,000,000; and

        (G) examines the effect of performance of the function by a
      contractor on the agency mission associated with the performance
      of the function.

      (2) A function that is performed by the executive agency and is
    reengineered, reorganized, modernized, upgraded, expanded, or
    changed to become more efficient, but still essentially provides
    the same service, shall not be considered a new requirement.
      (3) In no case may a function being performed by executive agency
    personnel be - 
        (A) modified, reorganized, divided, or in any way changed for
      the purpose of exempting the conversion of the function from the
      requirements of this section; or
        (B) converted to performance by a contractor to circumvent a
      civilian personnel ceiling.
    (b) Requirement to consult employees
      (1) Each civilian employee of an executive agency responsible for
    determining under Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76
    whether to convert to contractor performance any function of the
    executive agency - 
        (A) shall, at least monthly during the development and
      preparation of the performance work statement and the management
      efficiency study used in making that determination, consult with
      civilian employees who will be affected by that determination and
      consider the views of such employees on the development and
      preparation of that statement and that study; and
        (B) may consult with such employees on other matters relating
      to that determination.

      (2)(A) In the case of employees represented by a labor
    organization accorded exclusive recognition under section 7111 of
    title 5, consultation with representatives of that labor
    organization shall satisfy the consultation requirement in
    paragraph (1).
      (B) In the case of employees other than employees referred to in
    subparagraph (A), consultation with appropriate representatives of
    those employees shall satisfy the consultation requirement in
    paragraph (1).
      (C) The head of each executive agency shall prescribe regulations
    to carry out this subsection. The regulations shall include
    provisions for the selection or designation of appropriate
    representatives of employees referred to in paragraph (2)(B) for
    purposes of consultation required by paragraph (1).
    (c) Congressional notification
      (1) Before commencing a public-private competition under
    subsection (a), the head of an executive agency shall submit to
    Congress a report containing the following:
        (A) The function for which such public-private competition is
      to be conducted.
        (B) The location at which the function is performed by agency
      civilian employees.
        (C) The number of agency civilian employee positions
      potentially affected.
        (D) The anticipated length and cost of the public-private
      competition, and a specific identification of the budgetary line
      item from which funds will be used to cover the cost of the
      public-private competition.
        (E) A certification that a proposed performance of the function
      by a contractor is not a result of a decision by an official of
      an executive agency to impose predetermined constraints or
      limitations on such employees in terms of man years, end
      strengths, full-time equivalent positions, or maximum number of
      employees.

      (2) The report required under paragraph (1) shall include an
    examination of the potential economic effect of performance of the
    function by a contractor on - 
        (A) agency civilian employees who would be affected by such a
      conversion in performance; and
        (B) the local community and the Government, if more than 50
      agency civilian employees perform the function.

      (3)(A) A representative individual or entity at a facility where
    a public-private competition is conducted may submit to the head of
    the executive agency an objection to the public-private competition
    on the grounds that the report required by paragraph (1) has not
    been submitted or that the certification required by paragraph
    (1)(E) is not included in the report submitted as a condition for
    the public-private competition. The objection shall be in writing
    and shall be submitted within 90 days after the following date:
        (i) In the case of a failure to submit the report when
      required, the date on which the representative individual or an
      official of the representative entity authorized to pose the
      objection first knew or should have known of that failure.
        (ii) In the case of a failure to include the certification in a
      submitted report, the date on which the report was submitted to
      Congress.

      (B) If the head of the executive agency determines that the
    report required by paragraph (1) was not submitted or that the
    required certification was not included in the submitted report,
    the function for which the public-private competition was conducted
    for which the objection was submitted may not be the subject of a
    solicitation of offers for, or award of, a contract until,
    respectively, the report is submitted or a report containing the
    certification in full compliance with the certification requirement
    is submitted.
    (d) Exemption for the purchase of products and services of the
      blind and other severely handicapped persons
      This section shall not apply to a commercial or industrial type
    function of an executive agency that - 
        (1) is included on the procurement list established pursuant to
      section 2 of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 47); or
        (2) is planned to be changed to performance by a qualified
      nonprofit agency for the blind or by a qualified nonprofit agency
      for other severely handicapped persons in accordance with that
      Act [41 U.S.C. 46 et seq.].
    (e) Inapplicability during war or emergency
      The provisions of this section shall not apply during war or
    during a period of national emergency declared by the President or
    Congress.

    TITLE 41 - PUBLIC CONTRACTS
    CHAPTER 9 - CONTRACT DISPUTES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 605. Decision by contracting officer

-STATUTE-
    (a) Contractor claims
      All claims by a contractor against the government relating to a
    contract shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the
    contracting officer for a decision. All claims by the government
    against a contractor relating to a contract shall be the subject of
    a decision by the contracting officer. Each claim by a contractor
    against the government relating to a contract and each claim by the
    government against a contractor relating to a contract shall be
    submitted within 6 years after the accrual of the claim. The
    preceding sentence does not apply to a claim by the government
    against a contractor that is based on a claim by the contractor
    involving fraud. The contracting officer shall issue his decisions
    in writing, and shall mail or otherwise furnish a copy of the
    decision to the contractor. The decision shall state the reasons
    for the decision reached, and shall inform the contractor of his
    rights as provided in this chapter. Specific findings of fact are
    not required, but, if made, shall not be binding in any subsequent
    proceeding. The authority of this subsection shall not extend to a
    claim or dispute for penalties or forfeitures prescribed by statute
    or regulation which another Federal agency is specifically
    authorized to administer, settle, or determine. This section shall
    not authorize any agency head to settle, compromise, pay, or
    otherwise adjust any claim involving fraud.
    (b) Review; performance of contract pending appeal
      The contracting officer's decision on the claim shall be final
    and conclusive and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal, or
    Government agency, unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced as
    authorized by this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit
    executive agencies from including a clause in government contracts
    requiring that pending final decision of an appeal, action, or
    final settlement, a contractor shall proceed diligently with
    performance of the contract in accordance with the contracting
    officer's decision.
    (c) Amount of claim; certification; notification; time of issuance;
      presumption
      (1) A contracting officer shall issue a decision on any submitted
    claim of $100,000 or less within sixty days from his receipt of a
    written request from the contractor that a decision be rendered
    within that period. For claims of more than $100,000, the
    contractor shall certify that the claim is made in good faith, that
    the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of his
    knowledge and belief, that the amount requested accurately reflects
    the contract adjustment for which the contractor believes the
    government is liable, and that the certifier is duly authorized to
    certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.
      (2) A contracting officer shall, within sixty days of receipt of
    a submitted certified claim over $100,000 - 
        (A) issue a decision; or
        (B) notify the contractor of the time within which a decision
      will be issued.

      (3) The decision of a contracting officer on submitted claims
    shall be issued within a reasonable time, in accordance with
    regulations promulgated by the agency, taking into account such
    factors as the size and complexity of the claim and the adequacy of
    the information in support of the claim provided by the contractor.
      (4) A contractor may request the tribunal concerned to direct a
    contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of
    time, as determined by the tribunal concerned, in the event of
    undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.
      (5) Any failure by the contracting officer to issue a decision on
    a contract claim within the period required will be deemed to be a
    decision by the contracting officer denying the claim and will
    authorize the commencement of the appeal or suit on the claim as
    otherwise provided in this chapter. However, in the event an appeal
    or suit is so commenced in the absence of a prior decision by the
    contracting officer, the tribunal concerned may, at its option,
    stay the proceedings to obtain a decision on the claim by the
    contracting officer.
      (6) The contracting officer shall have no obligation to render a
    final decision on any claim of more than $100,000 that is not
    certified in accordance with paragraph (1) if, within 60 days after
    receipt of the claim, the contracting officer notifies the
    contractor in writing of the reasons why any attempted
    certification was found to be defective. A defect in the
    certification of a claim shall not deprive a court or an agency
    board of contract appeals of jurisdiction over that claim. Prior to
    the entry of a final judgment by a court or a decision by an agency
    board of contract appeals, the court or agency board shall require
    a defective certification to be corrected.
      (7) The certification required by paragraph (1) may be executed
    by any person duly authorized to bind the contractor with respect
    to the claim.
    (d) Alternative means of dispute resolution
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a contractor
    and a contracting officer may use any alternative means of dispute
    resolution under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5, or other
    mutually agreeable procedures, for resolving claims. The contractor
    shall certify the claim when required to do so as provided under
    subsection (c)(1) of this section or as otherwise required by law.
    All provisions of subchapter IV of chapter 5 of title 5 shall apply
    to such alternative means of dispute resolution.
    (e) Termination of authority to engage in alternative means of
      dispute resolution; savings provision
      In any case in which the contracting officer rejects a
    contractor's request for alternative dispute resolution
    proceedings, the contracting officer shall provide the contractor
    with a written explanation, citing one or more of the conditions in
    section 572(b) of title 5 or such other specific reasons that
    alternative dispute resolution procedures are inappropriate for the
    resolution of the dispute. In any case in which a contractor
    rejects a request of an agency for alternative dispute resolution
    proceedings, the contractor shall inform the agency in writing of
    the contractor's specific reasons for rejecting the request.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 607. Agency boards of contract appeals

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment; consultation; Tennessee Valley Authority
      (1) An Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals may be
    established within the Department of Defense when the Secretary of
    Defense, after consultation with the Administrator, determines from
    a workload study that the volume of contract claims justifies the
    establishment of a full-time agency board of at least three members
    who shall have no other inconsistent duties. Workload studies will
    be updated at least once every three years and submitted to the
    Administrator.
      (2) The Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority may
    establish a board of contract appeals for the Authority of an
    indeterminate number of members.
    (b) Appointment of members; chairman; compensation
      (1) The members of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals
    shall be selected and appointed to serve in the same manner as
    administrative law judges appointed pursuant to section 3105 of
    title 5, with an additional requirement that such members shall
    have had not fewer than five years' experience in public contract
    law. Full-time members of such Board serving as such on the
    effective date of this chapter shall be considered qualified. The
    chairman and vice chairman of such Board shall be designated by the
    Secretary of Defense from members so appointed. Compensation for
    the chairman, the vice chairman, and all other members of such
    Board shall be determined under section 5372a of title 5.
      (2) The Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority
    shall establish criteria for the appointment of members to its
    agency board of contract appeals established in subsection (a)(2)
    of this section, and shall designate a chairman of such board. The
    chairman and all other members of such board shall receive
    compensation, at the daily equivalent of the rates determined under
    section 5372a of title 5, for each day they are engaged in the
    actual performance of their duties as members of the board.
    (c) Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals
      There is established an agency board of contract appeals to be
    known as the "Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals". Such board
    shall have jurisdiction to decide any appeal from a decision of a
    contracting officer of the United States Postal Service or the
    Postal Regulatory Commission relative to a contract made by either
    agency. Such board shall consist of judges appointed by the
    Postmaster General who shall meet the qualifications of and serve
    in the same manner as members of the Civilian Board of Contract
    Appeals. This chapter shall apply to contract disputes before the
    Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals in the same manner as they
    apply to contract disputes before the Civilian Board.
    (d) Jurisdiction
      The Armed Services Board shall have jurisdiction to decide any
    appeal from a decision of a contracting officer of the Department
    of Defense, the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy,
    the Department of the Air Force, or the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration relative to a contract made by that department
    or agency. The Civilian Board shall have jurisdiction to decide any
    appeal from a decision of a contracting officer of any executive
    agency (other than the Department of Defense, the Department of the
    Army, the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Air Force,
    the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United
    States Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission, or the
    Tennessee Valley Authority) relative to a contract made by that
    agency. Each other agency board shall have jurisdiction to decide
    any appeal from a decision of a contracting officer relative to a
    contract made by its agency. In exercising this jurisdiction, the
    agency board is authorized to grant any relief that would be
    available to a litigant asserting a contract claim in the United
    States Court of Federal Claims.
    (e) Decisions
      An agency board shall provide to the fullest extent practicable,
    informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of disputes, and
    shall issue a decision in writing or take other appropriate action
    on each appeal submitted, and shall mail or otherwise furnish a
    copy of the decision to the contractor and the contracting officer.
    (f) Accelerated appeal disposition
      The rules of each agency board shall include a procedure for the
    accelerated disposition of any appeal from a decision of a
    contracting officer where the amount in dispute is $100,000 or
    less. The accelerated procedure shall be applicable at the sole
    election of only the contractor. Appeals under the accelerated
    procedure shall be resolved, whenever possible, within one hundred
    and eighty days from the date the contractor elects to utilize such
    procedure.
    (g) Review
      (1) The decision of an agency board of contract appeals shall be
    final, except that - 
        (A) a contractor may appeal such a decision to the United
      States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit within one
      hundred twenty days after the date of receipt of a copy of such
      decision, or
        (B) the agency head, if he determines that an appeal should be
      taken, and with the prior approval of the Attorney General,
      transmits the decision of the board of contract appeals to the
      Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for judicial review
      under section 1295 of title 28, within one hundred and twenty
      days from the date of the agency's receipt of a copy of the
      board's decision.

      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the decision
    of the board of contract appeals of the Tennessee Valley Authority
    shall be final, except that - 
        (A) a contractor may appeal such a decision to a United States
      district court pursuant to the provisions of section 1337 of
      title 28, within one hundred twenty days after the date of
      receipt of a copy of such decision, or
        (B) The Tennessee Valley Authority may appeal the decision to a
      United States district court pursuant to the provisions of
      section 1337 of title 28, within one hundred twenty days after
      the date of the decision in any case.

      (3) An award by an arbitrator under this chapter shall be
    reviewed pursuant to sections 9 through 13 of title 9, except that
    the court may set aside or limit any award that is found to violate
    limitations imposed by Federal statute.

    (a) Actions in United States Court of Federal Claims; district
      court actions; time for filing
      (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), and in lieu of appealing
    the decision of the contracting officer under section 605 of this
    title to an agency board, a contractor may bring an action directly
    on the claim in the United States Court of Federal Claims,
    notwithstanding any contract provision, regulation, or rule of law
    to the contrary.
      (2) In the case of an action against the Tennessee Valley
    Authority, the contractor may only bring an action directly on the
    claim in a United States district court pursuant to section 1337 of
    title 28, notwithstanding any contract provision, regulation, or
    rule of law to the contrary.
      (3) Any action under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be filed within
    twelve months from the date of the receipt by the contractor of the
    decision of the contracting officer concerning the claim, and shall
    proceed de novo in accordance with the rules of the appropriate
    court.
    (b) Finality of board decision
      In the event of an appeal by a contractor or the Government from
    a decision of any agency board pursuant to section 607 of this
    title, notwithstanding any contract provision, regulation, or rules
    of law to the contrary, the decision of the agency board on any
    question of law shall not be final or conclusive, but the decision
    on any question of fact shall be final and conclusive and shall not
    be set aside unless the decision is fraudulent, or arbitrary, or
    capricious, or so grossly erroneous as to necessarily imply bad
    faith, or if such decision is not supported by substantial
    evidence.
    (c) Remand or retention of case
      In any appeal by a contractor or the Government from a decision
    of an agency board pursuant to section 607 of this title, the court
    may render an opinion and judgement and remand the case for further
    action by the agency board or by the executive agency as
    appropriate, with such direction as the court considers just and
    proper.
    (d) Consolidation
      If two or more suits arising from one contract are filed in the
    United States Court of Federal Claims and one or more agency
    boards, for the convenience of parties or witnesses or in the
    interest of justice, the United States Court of Federal Claims may
    order the consolidation of such suits in that court or transfer any
    suits to or among the agency boards involved.
    (e) Judgments as to fewer than all claims
      In any suit filed pursuant to this chapter involving two or more
    claims, counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party claims, and
    where a portion of one such claim can be divided for purposes of
    decision or judgment, and in any such suit where multiple parties
    are involved, the court, whenever such action is appropriate, may
    enter a judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the
    claims, portions thereof, or parties.
    (f) Advisory opinions
      (1) Whenever an action involving an issue described in paragraph
    (2) is pending in a district court of the United States, the
    district court may request a board of contract appeals to provide
    the court with an advisory opinion on the matters of contract
    interpretation at issue.
      (2) An issue referred to in paragraph (1) is any issue that could
    be the proper subject of a final decision of a contracting officer
    appealable under this chapter.
      (3) A district court shall direct any request under paragraph (1)
    to the board of contract appeals having jurisdiction under this
    chapter to adjudicate appeals of contract claims under the contract
    or contracts being interpreted by the court.
      (4) After receiving a request for an advisory opinion under
    paragraph (1), a board of contract appeals shall provide the
    advisory opinion in a timely manner to the district court making
    the request.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Drug-free workplace requirement
      (1) Requirement for persons other than individuals
        No person, other than an individual, shall be considered a
      responsible source, under the meaning of such term as defined in
      section 403(8) of this title, for the purposes of being awarded a
      contract for the procurement of any property or services of a
      value greater than the simplified acquisition threshold (as
      defined in section 403(11) of this title) by any Federal agency,
      other than a contract for the procurement of commercial items (as
      defined in section 403(12) of this title), unless such person
      agrees to provide a drug-free workplace by - 
          (A) publishing a statement notifying employees that the
        unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession,
        or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in the person's
        workplace and specifying the actions that will be taken against
        employees for violations of such prohibition;
          (B) establishing a drug-free awareness program to inform
        employees about - 
            (i) the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
            (ii) the person's policy of maintaining a drug-free
          workplace;
            (iii) any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and
          employee assistance programs; and
            (iv) the penalties that may be imposed upon employees for
          drug abuse violations;

          (C) making it a requirement that each employee to be engaged
        in the performance of such contract be given a copy of the
        statement required by subparagraph (A);
          (D) notifying the employee in the statement required by
        subparagraph (A), that as a condition of employment on such
        contract, the employee will - 
            (i) abide by the terms of the statement; and
            (ii) notify the employer of any criminal drug statute
          conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no
          later than 5 days after such conviction;

          (E) notifying the contracting agency within 10 days after
        receiving notice under subparagraph (D)(ii) from an employee or
        otherwise receiving actual notice of such conviction;
          (F) imposing a sanction on, or requiring the satisfactory
        participation in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation
        program by, any employee who is so convicted, as required by
        section 703 of this title; and
          (G) making a good faith effort to continue to maintain a drug-
        free workplace through implementation of subparagraphs (A),
        (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F).
      (2) Requirement for individuals
        No Federal agency shall enter into a contract with an
      individual unless such individual agrees that the individual will
      not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution,
      dispensation, possession, or use of a controlled substance in the
      performance of the contract.
    (b) Suspension, termination, or debarment of contractor
      (1) Grounds for suspension, termination, or debarment
        Each contract awarded by a Federal agency shall be subject to
      suspension of payments under the contract or termination of the
      contract, or both, and the contractor thereunder or the
      individual who entered the contract with the Federal agency, as
      applicable, shall be subject to suspension or debarment in
      accordance with the requirements of this section if the head of
      the agency determines that - 
          (A) the contractor violates the requirements of subparagraph
        (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), or (F) of subsection (a)(1) of this
        section; or
          (B) such a number of employees of such contractor have been
        convicted of violations of criminal drug statutes for
        violations occurring in the workplace as to indicate that the
        contractor has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a
        drug-free workplace as required by subsection (a) of this
        section.
      (2) Conduct of suspension, termination, and debarment proceedings
        (A) If a contracting officer determines, in writing, that cause
      for suspension of payments, termination, or suspension or
      debarment exists, an appropriate action shall be initiated by a
      contracting officer of the agency, to be conducted by the agency
      concerned in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation
      and applicable agency procedures.
        (B) The Federal Acquisition Regulation shall be revised to
      include rules for conducting suspension and debarment proceedings
      under this subsection, including rules providing notice,
      opportunity to respond in writing or in person, and such other
      procedures as may be necessary to provide a full and fair
      proceeding to a contractor or individual in such proceeding.
      (3) Effect of debarment
        Upon issuance of any final decision under this subsection
      requiring debarment of a contractor or individual, such
      contractor or individual shall be ineligible for award of any
      contract by any Federal agency, and for participation in any
      future procurement by any Federal agency, for a period specified
      in the decision, not to exceed 5 years.

    Sec. 704. Waiver

-STATUTE-
    (a) In general
      A termination, suspension of payments, or suspension or debarment
    under this chapter may be waived by the head of an agency with
    respect to a particular contract or grant if - 
        (1) in the case of a waiver with respect to a contract, the
      head of the agency determines under section 701(b)(1) of this
      title, after the issuance of a final determination under such
      section, that suspension of payments, or termination of the
      contract, or suspension or debarment of the contractor, or
      refusal to permit a person to be treated as a responsible source
      for a contract, as the case may be, would severely disrupt the
      operation of such agency to the detriment of the Federal
      Government or the general public; or
        (2) in the case of a waiver with respect to a grant, the head
      of the agency determines that suspension of payments, termination
      of the grant, or suspension or debarment of the grantee would not
      be in the public interest.
    (b) Exclusive authority
      The authority of the head of an agency under this section to
    waive a termination, suspension, or debarment shall not be
    delegated.
